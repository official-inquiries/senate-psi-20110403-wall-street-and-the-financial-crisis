Wall Street and The Financial Crisis: 

Anatomy of a Financial Collapse 

April 13, 2011 

 

 

 
In the fall of 2008, America suffered a devastating economic collapse.  Once valuable 
 
securities lost most or all of their value, debt markets froze, stock markets plunged, and storied 
financial firms went under.  Millions of Americans lost their jobs; millions of families lost their 
homes; and good businesses shut down.  These events cast the United States into an economic 
recession so deep that the country has yet to fully recover.    

 
This Report is the product of a two-year bipartisan investigation by the U.S. Senate 
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations into the origins of the 2008 financial crisis.  The 
goals of this investigation were to construct a public record of the facts in order to deepen the 
understanding of what happened; identify some of the root causes of the crisis; and provide a 
factual foundation for the ongoing effort to fortify the country against the recurrence of a similar 
crisis in the future.   

 
Using internal documents, communications, and interviews, the Report attempts to 
provide the clearest picture yet of what took place inside the walls of some of the financial 
institutions and regulatory agencies that contributed to the crisis.  The investigation found that 
the crisis was not a natural disaster, but the result of high risk, complex financial products; 
undisclosed conflicts of interest; and the failure of regulators, the credit rating agencies, and the 
market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street.   

 
While this Report does not attempt to examine every key moment, or analyze every

important cause of the crisis, it provides new, detailed, and compelling evidence of what 
happened.  In so doing, we hope the Report leads to solutions that prevent it from happening 
again.

investigation into some of the key causes of the financial crisis.  Since then, the Subcommittee 
has engaged in a wide-ranging inquiry, issuing subpoenas, conducting over 150 interviews and 
depositions, and consulting with dozens of government, academic, and private sector experts.  
The Subcommittee has accumulated and reviewed tens of millions of pages of documents, 
including court pleadings, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, trustee reports, 
prospectuses for public and private offerings, corporate board and committee minutes, mortgage 
transactions and analyses, memoranda, marketing materials, correspondence, and emails.  The 
Subcommittee has also reviewed documents prepared by or sent to or from banking and

Case Study of Washington Mutual Bank 

 

 

 
securities regulators, including bank examination reports, reviews of securities firms, 
enforcement actions, analyses, memoranda, correspondence, and emails. 

 
 
In April 2010, the Subcommittee held four hearings examining four root causes of the 
financial crisis.  Using case studies detailed in thousands of pages of documents released at the 
hearings, the Subcommittee presented and examined evidence showing how high risk lending by 
U.S. financial institutions; regulatory failures; inflated credit ratings; and high risk, poor quality 
financial products designed and sold by some investment banks, contributed to the financial 
crisis.  This Report expands on those hearings and the case studies they featured.  The case 
studies are Washington Mutual Bank, the largest bank failure in U.S. history; the federal Office 
of Thrift Supervision which oversaw Washington Mutual’s demise; Moody’s and Standard & 
Poor’s, the country’s two largest credit rating agencies; and Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, 
two leaders in the design, marketing, and sale of mortgage related securities.  This Report 
devotes a chapter to how each of the four causative factors, as illustrated by the case studies, 
fueled the 2008 financial crisis, providing findings of fact, analysis of the issues, and 
recommendations for next steps. 

2 

 

The first chapter focuses on how high risk mortgage lending contributed to the financial 

crisis, using as a case study Washington Mutual Bank (WaMu).  At the time of its failure, WaMu 
was the nation’s largest thrift and sixth largest bank, with $300 billion in assets, $188 billion in 
deposits, 2,300 branches in 15 states, and over 43,000 employees.  Beginning in 2004, it 
embarked upon a lending strategy to pursue higher profits by emphasizing high risk loans.  By 
2006, WaMu’s high risk loans began incurring high rates of delinquency and default, and in 
2007, its mortgage backed securities began incurring ratings downgrades and losses.  Also in 
2007, the bank itself began incurring losses due to a portfolio that contained poor quality and 
fraudulent loans and securities.  Its stock price dropped as shareholders lost confidence, and 
depositors began withdrawing funds, eventually causing a liquidity crisis at the bank.  On 
September 25, 2008, WaMu was seized by its regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, placed 
in receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and sold to JPMorgan 
Chase for $1.9 billion.  Had the sale not gone through, WaMu’s failure might have exhausted the 
entire $45 billion Deposit Insurance Fund.   

 
This case study focuses on how one bank’s search for increased growth and profit led to 

the origination and securitization of hundreds of billions of dollars in high risk, poor quality 
mortgages that ultimately plummeted in value, hurting investors, the bank, and the U.S. financial 
system.  WaMu had held itself out as a prudent lender, but in reality, the bank turned 
increasingly to higher risk loans.  Over a four-year period, those higher risk loans grew from 
19% of WaMu’s loan originations in 2003, to 55% in 2006, while its lower risk, fixed rate loans 
fell from 64% to 25% of its originations.  At the same time, WaMu increased its securitization of 

3 

 
subprime loans sixfold, primarily through its subprime lender, Long Beach Mortgage 
Corporation, increasing such loans from nearly $4.5 billion in 2003, to $29 billion in 2006.  
From 2000 to 2007, WaMu and Long Beach together securitized at least $77 billion in subprime 
loans. 

 
WaMu also originated an increasing number of its flagship product, Option Adjustable 

Rate Mortgages (Option ARMs), which created high risk, negatively amortizing mortgages and, 
from 2003 to 2007, represented as much as half of all of WaMu’s loan originations.  In 2006 
alone, Washington Mutual originated more than $42.6 billion in Option ARM loans and sold or 
securitized at least $115 billion to investors, including sales to the Federal National Mortgage 
Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).  In 
addition, WaMu greatly increased its origination and securitization of high risk home equity loan 
products.  By 2007, home equity loans made up $63.5 billion or 27% of its home loan portfolio, 
a 130% increase from 2003.   

 
At the same time that WaMu was implementing its high risk lending strategy, WaMu and 

Long Beach engaged in a host of shoddy lending practices that produced billions of dollars in 
high risk, poor quality mortgages and mortgage backed securities.  Those practices included 
qualifying high risk borrowers for larger loans than they could afford; steering borrowers from 
conventional mortgages to higher risk loan products; accepting loan applications without 
verifying the borrower’s income; using loans with low, short term “teaser” rates that could lead 
to payment shock when higher interest rates took effect later on; promoting negatively 
amortizing loans in which many borrowers increased rather than paid down their debt; and 
authorizing loans with multiple layers of risk.  In addition, WaMu and Long Beach failed to 
enforce compliance with their own lending standards; allowed excessive loan error and exception 
rates; exercised weak oversight over the third party mortgage brokers who supplied half or more 
of their loans; and tolerated the issuance of loans with fraudulent or erroneous borrower 
information.  They also designed compensation incentives that rewarded loan personnel for 
issuing a large volume of higher risk loans, valuing speed and volume over loan quality. 

 
As a result, WaMu, and particularly its Long Beach subsidiary, became known by 

industry insiders for its failed mortgages and poorly performing residential mortgage backed 
securities (RMBS).  Among sophisticated investors, its securitizations were understood to be 
some of the worst performing in the marketplace.  Inside the bank, WaMu’s President Steve 
Rotella described Long Beach as “terrible” and “a mess,” with default rates that were “ugly.”  
WaMu’s high risk lending operation was also problem-plagued.  WaMu management was 
provided with compelling evidence of deficient lending practices in internal emails, audit reports, 
and reviews.  Internal reviews of two high volume WaMu loan centers, for example, described 
“extensive fraud” by employees who “willfully” circumvented bank policies.  A WaMu review 
of internal controls to stop fraudulent loans from being sold to investors described them as 
“ineffective.”  On at least one occasion, senior managers knowingly sold delinquency-prone 
loans to investors.  Aside from Long Beach, WaMu’s President described WaMu’s prime home 
loan business as the “worst managed business” he had seen in his career. 

 

4 

 

 

Documents obtained by the Subcommittee reveal that WaMu launched its high risk 

lending strategy primarily because higher risk loans and mortgage backed securities could be 
sold for higher prices on Wall Street.  They garnered higher prices because higher risk meant the 
securities paid a higher coupon rate than other comparably rated securities, and investors paid a 
higher price to buy them.  Selling or securitizing the loans also removed them from WaMu’s 
books and appeared to insulate the bank from risk.   

 
The Subcommittee investigation indicates that unacceptable lending and securitization 

practices were not restricted to Washington Mutual, but were present at a host of financial 
institutions that originated, sold, and securitized billions of dollars in high risk, poor quality 
home loans that inundated U.S. financial markets.  Many of the resulting securities ultimately 
plummeted in value, leaving banks and investors with huge losses that helped send the economy 
into a downward spiral.  These lenders were not the victims of the financial crisis; the high risk 
loans they issued were the fuel that ignited the financial crisis. 

 

(2)  Regulatory Failure:   
 

Case Study of the Office of Thrift Supervision 

The next chapter focuses on the failure of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) to stop 

the unsafe and unsound practices that led to the demise of Washington Mutual, one of the 
nation’s largest banks.  Over a five year period from 2004 to 2008, OTS identified over 500 
serious deficiencies at WaMu, yet failed to take action to force the bank to improve its lending 
operations and even impeded oversight by the bank’s backup regulator, the FDIC.   
 

Washington Mutual Bank was the largest thrift under the supervision of OTS and was 
among the eight largest financial institutions insured by the FDIC.  Until 2006, WaMu was a 
profitable bank, but in 2007, many of its high risk home loans began experiencing increased rates 
of delinquency, default, and loss.  After the market for subprime mortgage backed securities 
collapsed in July 2007, Washington Mutual was unable to sell or securitize its subprime loans 
and its loan portfolio fell in value.  In September 2007, WaMu’s stock price plummeted against 
the backdrop of its losses and a worsening financial crisis.  From 2007 to 2008, WaMu’s 
depositors withdrew a total of over $26 billion in deposits from the bank, triggering a liquidity 
crisis, followed by the bank’s closure. 

 
OTS records show that, during the five years prior to WaMu’s collapse, OTS examiners 

repeatedly identified significant problems with Washington Mutual’s lending practices, risk 
management, asset quality, and appraisal practices, and requested corrective action.  Year after 
year, WaMu promised to correct the identified problems, but never did.  OTS failed to respond 
with meaningful enforcement action, such as by downgrading WaMu’s rating for safety and 
soundness, requiring a public plan with deadlines for corrective actions, or imposing civil fines 
for inaction.  To the contrary, until shortly before the thrift’s failure in 2008, OTS continually 
rated WaMu as financially sound.   

The agency’s failure to restrain WaMu’s unsafe lending practices stemmed in part from 

an OTS regulatory culture that viewed its thrifts as “constituents,” relied on bank management to 

5 

 
correct identified problems with minimal regulatory intervention, and expressed reluctance to 
interfere with even unsound lending and securitization practices.  OTS displayed an unusual 
amount of deference to WaMu’s management, choosing to rely on the bank to police itself in its 
use of safe and sound practices.  The reasoning appeared to be that if OTS examiners simply 
identified the problems at the bank, OTS could then rely on WaMu’s assurances that problems 
would be corrected, with little need for tough enforcement actions.  It was a regulatory approach 
with disastrous results.  

Despite identifying over 500 serious deficiencies in five years, OTS did not once, from 

2004 to 2008, take a public enforcement action against Washington Mutual to correct its lending 
practices, nor did it lower the bank’s rating for safety and soundness.  Only in 2008, as the bank 
incurred mounting losses, did OTS finally take two informal, nonpublic enforcement actions, 
requiring WaMu to agree to a “Board Resolution” in March and a “Memorandum of 
Understanding” in September, neither of which imposed sufficient changes to prevent the bank’s 
failure.  OTS officials resisted calls by the FDIC, the bank’s backup regulator, for stronger 
measures and even impeded FDIC oversight efforts by at times denying FDIC examiners office 
space and access to bank records.  Tensions between the two agencies remained high until the 
end.  Two weeks before the bank was seized, the FDIC Chairman contacted WaMu directly to 
inform it that the FDIC was likely to have a ratings disagreement with OTS and downgrade the 
bank’s safety and soundness rating, and informed the OTS Director about that communication, 
prompting him to complain about the FDIC Chairman’s “audacity.”   

Hindered by a culture of deference to management, demoralized examiners, and agency 
infighting, OTS officials allowed the bank’s short term profits to excuse its risky practices and 
failed to evaluate the bank’s actions in the context of the U.S. financial system as a whole.  Its 
narrow regulatory focus prevented OTS from analyzing or acknowledging until it was too late 
that WaMu’s practices could harm the broader economy. 

OTS’ failure to restrain Washington Mutual’s unsafe lending practices allowed high risk 

loans at the bank to proliferate, negatively impacting investors across the United States and 
around the world.  Similar regulatory failings by other agencies involving other lenders repeated 
the problem on a broad scale.  The result was a mortgage market saturated with risky loans, and 
financial institutions that were supposed to hold predominantly safe investments but instead held 
portfolios rife with high risk, poor quality mortgages.  When those loans began defaulting in 
record numbers and mortgage related securities plummeted in value, financial institutions around 
the globe suffered hundreds of billions of dollars in losses, triggering an economic disaster.  The 
regulatory failures that set the stage for those losses were a proximate cause of the financial 
crisis. 

Case Study of Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s 

(3)  Inflated Credit Ratings: 
 
 
The next chapter examines how inflated credit ratings contributed to the financial crisis 

 

by masking the true risk of many mortgage related securities.  Using case studies involving 
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC 

 
(S&P), the nation’s two largest credit rating agencies, the Subcommittee identified multiple 
problems responsible for the inaccurate ratings, including conflicts of interest that placed 
achieving market share and increased revenues ahead of ensuring accurate ratings.  

6 

 
Between 2004 and 2007, Moody’s and S&P issued credit ratings for tens of thousands of 
U.S. residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO).  
Taking in increasing revenue from Wall Street firms, Moody’s and S&P issued AAA and other 
investment grade credit ratings for the vast majority of those RMBS and CDO securities, 
deeming them safe investments even though many relied on high risk home loans.1
   In late 
2006, high risk mortgages began incurring delinquencies and defaults at an alarming rate.  
Despite signs of a deteriorating mortgage market, Moody’s and S&P continued for six months to 
issue investment grade ratings for numerous RMBS and CDO securities.   

 
Then, in July 2007, as mortgage delinquencies intensified and RMBS and CDO securities 

began incurring losses, both companies abruptly reversed course and began downgrading at 
record numbers hundreds and then thousands of their RMBS and CDO ratings, some less than a 
year old.  Investors like banks, pension funds, and insurance companies, who are by rule barred 
from owning low rated securities, were forced to sell off their downgraded RMBS and CDO 
holdings, because they had lost their investment grade status.  RMBS and CDO securities held 
by financial firms lost much of their value, and new securitizations were unable to find investors.  
The subprime RMBS market initially froze and then collapsed, leaving investors and financial 
firms around the world holding unmarketable subprime RMBS securities that were plummeting 
in value.  A few months later, the CDO market collapsed as well.  

 
Traditionally, investments holding AAA ratings have had a less than 1% probability of 

incurring defaults.  But in 2007, the vast majority of RMBS and CDO securities with AAA 
ratings incurred substantial losses; some failed outright.  Analysts have determined that over 
90% of the AAA ratings given to subprime RMBS securities originated in 2006 and 2007 were 
later downgraded by the credit rating agencies to junk status.  In the case of Long Beach, 75 out 
of 75 AAA rated Long Beach securities issued in 2006, were later downgraded to junk status, 
defaulted, or withdrawn.  Investors and financial institutions holding the AAA rated securities 
lost significant value.  Those widespread losses led, in turn, to a loss of investor confidence in 
the value of the AAA rating, in the holdings of major U.S. financial institutions, and even in the 
viability of U.S. financial markets.   

 
Inaccurate AAA credit ratings introduced risk into the U.S. financial system and 

constituted a key cause of the financial crisis.  In addition, the July mass downgrades, which 
were unprecedented in number and scope, precipitated the collapse of the RMBS and CDO 
secondary markets, and perhaps more than any other single event triggered the beginning of the 
financial crisis.

Report will refer to both ratings as “AAA.” 

 

7 

The Subcommittee’s investigation uncovered a host of factors responsible for the 

inaccurate credit ratings issued by Moody’s and S&P.  One significant cause was the inherent 
conflict of interest arising from the system used to pay for credit ratings.  Credit rating agencies 
were paid by the Wall Street firms that sought their ratings and profited from the financial 
products being rated.  Under this “issuer pays” model, the rating agencies were dependent upon 
those Wall Street firms to bring them business, and were vulnerable to threats that the firms 
would take their business elsewhere if they did not get the ratings they wanted.  The rating 
agencies weakened their standards as each competed to provide the most favorable rating to win 
business and greater market share.  The result was a race to the bottom.   

 
Additional factors responsible for the inaccurate ratings include rating models that failed 
to include relevant mortgage performance data; unclear and subjective criteria used to produce 
ratings; a failure to apply updated rating models to existing rated transactions; and a failure to 
provide adequate staffing to perform rating and surveillance services, despite record revenues.  
Compounding these problems were federal regulations that required the purchase of investment 
grade securities by banks and others, which created pressure on the credit rating agencies to issue 
investment grade ratings.  While these federal regulations were intended to help investors stay 
away from unsafe securities, they had the opposite effect when the AAA ratings proved 
inaccurate.   

 
Evidence gathered by the Subcommittee shows that the credit rating agencies were aware 

of problems in the mortgage market, including an unsustainable rise in housing prices, the high 
risk nature of the loans being issued, lax lending standards, and rampant mortgage fraud.  Instead 
of using this information to temper their ratings, the firms continued to issue a high volume of 
investment grade ratings for mortgage backed securities.  If the credit rating agencies had issued 
ratings that accurately reflected the increasing risk in the RMBS and CDO markets and 
appropriately adjusted existing ratings in those markets, they might have discouraged investors 
from purchasing high risk RMBS and CDO securities, and slowed the pace of securitizations. 

 
It was not in the short term economic interest of either Moody’s or S&P, however, to 

provide accurate credit ratings for high risk RMBS and CDO securities, because doing so would 
have hurt their own revenues.  Instead, the credit rating agencies’ profits became increasingly 
reliant on the fees generated by issuing a large volume of structured finance ratings.  In the end, 
Moody’s and S&P provided AAA ratings to tens of thousands of high risk RMBS and CDO 
securities and then, when those products began to incur losses, issued mass downgrades that 
shocked the financial markets, hammered the value of the mortgage related securities, and helped 
trigger the financial crisis.   
 

Case Study of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank 

(4)  Investment Bank Abuses:  
 
 
The final chapter examines how investment banks contributed to the financial crisis, 

 

 

 

using as case studies Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, two leading participants in the U.S. 
mortgage market.

Investment banks can play an important role in the U.S. economy, helping to channel the 
nation’s wealth into productive activities that create jobs and increase economic growth.  But in 
the years leading up to the financial crisis, large investment banks designed and promoted 
complex financial instruments, often referred to as structured finance products, that were at the 
heart of the crisis.  They included RMBS and CDO securities, credit default swaps (CDS), and 
CDS contracts linked to the ABX Index.  These complex, high risk financial products were 
engineered, sold, and traded by the major U.S. investment banks.  
 

From 2004 to 2008, U.S. financial institutions issued nearly $2.5 trillion in RMBS and 

over $1.4 trillion in CDO securities, backed primarily by mortgage related products.  Investment 
banks typically charged fees of $1 to $8 million to act as the underwriter of an RMBS 
securitization, and $5 to $10 million to act as the placement agent for a CDO securitization.  
Those fees contributed substantial revenues to the investment banks, which established internal 
structured finance groups, as well as a variety of RMBS and CDO origination and trading desks 
within those groups, to handle mortgage related securitizations.  Investment banks sold RMBS 
and CDO securities to investors around the world, and helped develop a secondary market where 
RMBS and CDO securities could be traded.  The investment banks’ trading desks participated in 
those secondary markets, buying and selling RMBS and CDO securities either on behalf of their 
clients or in connection with their own proprietary transactions.  

 
The financial products developed by investment banks allowed investors to profit, not 

only from the success of an RMBS or CDO securitization, but also from its failure.  CDS 
contracts, for example, allowed counterparties to wager on the rise or fall in the value of a 
specific RMBS security or on a collection of RMBS and other assets contained or referenced in a 
CDO.  Major investment banks developed standardized CDS contracts that could also be traded 
on a secondary market.  In addition, they established the ABX Index which allowed 
counterparties to wager on the rise or fall in the value of a basket of subprime RMBS securities, 
which could be used to reflect the status of the subprime mortgage market as a whole.  The 
investment banks sometimes matched up parties who wanted to take opposite sides in a 
transaction and other times took one or the other side of the transaction to accommodate a client.  
At still other times, investment banks used these financial instruments to make their own 
proprietary wagers.  In extreme cases, some investment banks set up structured finance 
transactions which enabled them to profit at the expense of their clients.  

 
Two case studies, involving Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, illustrate a variety of 
troubling practices that raise conflicts of interest and other concerns involving RMBS, CDO, 
CDS, and ABX related financial instruments that contributed to the financial crisis.   

 
The Goldman Sachs case study focuses on how it used net short positions to benefit from 

the downturn in the mortgage market, and designed, marketed, and sold CDOs in ways that 
created conflicts of interest with the firm’s clients and at times led to the bank=s profiting from 
the same products that caused substantial losses for its clients. 

 
From 2004 to 2008, Goldman was a major player in the U.S. mortgage market.  In 2006 

and 2007 alone, it designed and underwrote 93 RMBS and 27 mortgage related CDO 

9 

 
securitizations totaling about $100 billion, bought and sold RMBS and CDO securities on behalf 
of its clients, and amassed its own multi-billion-dollar proprietary mortgage related holdings.  In 
December 2006, however, when it saw evidence that the high risk mortgages underlying many 
RMBS and CDO securities were incurring accelerated rates of delinquency and default, 
Goldman quietly and abruptly reversed course. 

 
Over the next two months, it rapidly sold off or wrote down the bulk of its existing 

subprime RMBS and CDO inventory, and began building a short position that would allow it to 
profit from the decline of the mortgage market.  Throughout 2007, Goldman twice built up and 
cashed in sizeable mortgage related short positions.  At its peak, Goldman’s net short position 
totaled $13.9 billion.  Overall in 2007, its net short position produced record profits totaling $3.7 
billion for Goldman’s Structured Products Group, which when combined with other mortgage 
losses, produced record net revenues of $1.1 billion for the Mortgage Department as a whole. 

 
Throughout 2007, Goldman sold RMBS and CDO securities to its clients without 
disclosing its own net short position against the subprime market or its purchase of CDS 
contracts to gain from the loss in value of some of the very securities it was selling to its clients.  

 
The case study examines in detail four CDOs that Goldman constructed and sold called 
Hudson 1, Anderson, Timberwolf, and Abacus 2007-AC1.  In some cases, Goldman transferred 
risky assets from its own inventory into these CDOs; in others, it included poor quality assets 
that were likely to lose value or not perform.  In three of the CDOs, Hudson, Anderson and 
Timberwolf, Goldman took a substantial portion of the short side of the CDO, essentially betting 
that the assets within the CDO would fall in value or not perform.  Goldman’s short position was 
in direct opposition to the clients to whom it was selling the CDO securities, yet it failed to 
disclose the size and nature of its short position while marketing the securities.  While Goldman 
sometimes included obscure language in its marketing materials about the possibility of its 
taking a short position on the CDO securities it was selling, Goldman did not disclose to 
potential investors when it had already determined to take or had already taken short investments 
that would pay off if the particular security it was selling, or RMBS and CDO securities in 
general, performed poorly.  In the case of Hudson 1, for example, Goldman took 100% of the 
short side of the $2 billion CDO, betting against the assets referenced in the CDO, and sold the 
Hudson securities to investors without disclosing its short position.  When the securities lost 
value, Goldman made a $1.7 billion gain at the direct expense of the clients to whom it had sold 
the securities.   

 
In the case of Anderson, Goldman selected a large number of poorly performing assets 

for the CDO, took 40% of the short position, and then marketed Anderson securities to its 
clients.  When a client asked how Goldman “got comfortable” with the New Century loans in the 
CDO, Goldman personnel tried to dispel concerns about the loans, and did not disclose the firm’s 
own negative view of them or its short position in the CDO.   

 
In the case of Timberwolf, Goldman sold the securities to its clients even as it knew the 
securities were falling in value.  In some cases, Goldman knowingly sold Timberwolf securities 
to clients at prices above its own book values and, within days or weeks of the sale, marked 

10 

 
down the value of the sold securities, causing its clients to incur quick losses and requiring some 
to post higher margin or cash collateral.  Timberwolf securities lost 80% of their value within 
five months of being issued and today are worthless.  Goldman took 36% of the short position in 
the CDO and made money from that investment, but ultimately lost money when it could not sell 
all of the Timberwolf securities. 

 
In the case of Abacus, Goldman did not take the short position, but allowed a hedge fund, 

Paulson & Co. Inc., that planned on shorting the CDO to play a major but hidden role in 
selecting its assets.  Goldman marketed Abacus securities to its clients, knowing the CDO was 
designed to lose value and without disclosing the hedge fund’s asset selection role or investment 
objective to potential investors.  Three long investors together lost about $1 billion from their 
Abacus investments, while the Paulson hedge fund profited by about the same amount.  Today, 
the Abacus securities are worthless.   

 
In the Hudson and Timberwolf CDOs, Goldman also used its role as the collateral put 
provider or liquidation agent to advance its financial interest to the detriment of the clients to 
whom it sold the CDO securities. 

 
The Deutsche Bank case study describes how the bank’s top global CDO trader, Greg 

Lippmann, repeatedly warned and advised his Deutsche Bank colleagues and some of his clients 
seeking to buy short positions about the poor quality of the RMBS securities underlying many 
CDOs.  He described some of those securities as “crap” and “pigs,” and predicted the assets and 
the CDO securities would lose value.  At one point, Mr. Lippmann was asked to buy a specific 
CDO security and responded that it “rarely trades,” but he “would take it and try to dupe 
someone” into buying it.  He also at times referred to the industry’s ongoing CDO marketing 
efforts as a “CDO machine” or “ponzi scheme.”  Deutsche Bank’s senior management disagreed 
with his negative views, and used the bank’s own funds to make large proprietary investments in 
mortgage related securities that, in 2007, had a notional or face value of $128 billion and a 
market value of more than $25 billion.  Despite its positive view of the housing market, the bank 
allowed Mr. Lippmann to develop a large proprietary short position for the bank in the RMBS 
market, which from 2005 to 2007, totaled $5 billion.  The bank cashed in the short position from 
2007 to 2008, generating a profit of $1.5 billion, which Mr. Lippmann claims is more money on 
a single position than any other trade had ever made for Deutsche Bank in its history.  Despite 
that gain, due to its large long holdings, Deutsche Bank lost nearly $4.5 billion from its mortgage 
related proprietary investments. 
 
 
known as Gemstone CDO VII Ltd. (Gemstone 7), which issued securities in March 2007.  It was 
one of 47 CDOs totaling $32 billion that Deutsche Bank underwrote from 2004 to 2008.  
Deutsche Bank made $4.7 million in fees from Gemstone 7, while the collateral manager, a 
hedge fund called HBK Capital Management, was slated to receive $3.3 million.  Gemstone 7 
concentrated risk by including within a single financial instrument 115 RMBS securities whose 
financial success depended upon thousands of high risk, poor quality subprime loans.  Many of 
those RMBS securities carried BBB, BBB-, or even BB credit ratings, making them among the 
highest risk RMBS securities sold to the public.  Nearly a third of the RMBS securities contained 

The Subcommittee also examined a $1.1 billion CDO underwritten by Deutsche Bank 

11 

 
subprime loans originated by Fremont, Long Beach, and New Century, lenders well known 
within the industry for issuing poor quality loans.  Deutsche Bank also sold securities directly 
from its own inventory to the CDO.  Deutsche Bank’s CDO trading desk knew that many of 
these RMBS securities were likely to lose value, but did not object to their inclusion in 
Gemstone 7, even securities which Mr. Lippmann was calling “crap” or “pigs.”  Despite the poor 
quality of the underlying assets, Gemstone’s top three tranches received AAA ratings.  Deutsche 
Bank ultimately sold about $700 million in Gemstone securities, without disclosing to potential 
investors that its global head trader of CDOs had extremely negative views of a third of the 
assets in the CDO or that the bank’s internal valuations showed that the assets had lost over $19 
million in value since their purchase.  Within months of being issued, the Gemstone 7 securities 
lost value; by November 2007, they began undergoing credit rating downgrades; and by July 
2008, they became nearly worthless.   

 
 
 
 

 
Both Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank underwrote securities using loans from 

subprime lenders known for issuing high risk, poor quality mortgages, and sold risky securities 
to investors across the United States and around the world.  They also enabled the lenders to 
acquire new funds to originate still more high risk, poor quality loans.  Both sold CDO securities 
without full disclosure of the negative views of some of their employees regarding the 
underlying assets and, in the case of Goldman, without full disclosure that it was shorting the 
very CDO securities it was marketing, raising questions about whether Goldman complied with 
its obligations to issue suitable investment recommendations and disclose material adverse 
interests.  

 
The case studies also illustrate how these two investment banks continued to market new 
CDOs in 2007, even as U.S. mortgage delinquencies intensified, RMBS securities lost value, the 
U.S. mortgage market as a whole deteriorated, and investors lost confidence.  Both kept 
producing and selling high risk, poor quality structured finance products in a negative market, in 
part because stopping the “CDO machine” would have meant less income for structured finance 
units, smaller executive bonuses, and even the disappearance of CDO desks and personnel, 
which is what finally happened.  The two case studies also illustrate how certain complex 
structured finance products, such as synthetic CDOs and naked credit default swaps, amplified 
market risk by allowing investors with no ownership interest in the reference obligations to place 
unlimited side bets on their performance.  Finally, the two case studies demonstrate how 
proprietary trading led to dramatic losses in the case of Deutsche Bank and undisclosed conflicts 
of interest in the case of Goldman Sachs.   
 

Investment banks were the driving force behind the structured finance products that 

provided a steady stream of funding for lenders originating high risk, poor quality loans and that 
magnified risk throughout the U.S. financial system.   The investment banks that engineered, 
sold, traded, and profited from mortgage related structured finance products were a major cause 
of the financial crisis.  

12 

 

C.  Recommendations 
 
The four causative factors examined in this Report are interconnected.  Lenders 

introduced new levels of risk into the U.S. financial system by selling and securitizing complex 
home loans with high risk features and poor underwriting.  The credit rating agencies labeled the 
resulting securities as safe investments, facilitating their purchase by institutional investors 
around the world.  Federal banking regulators failed to ensure safe and sound lending practices 
and risk management, and stood on the sidelines as large financial institutions active in U.S. 
financial markets purchased billions of dollars in mortgage related securities containing high 
risk, poor quality mortgages.  Investment banks magnified the risk to the system by engineering 
and promoting risky mortgage related structured finance products, and enabling investors to use 
naked credit default swaps and synthetic instruments to bet on the failure rather than the success 
of U.S. financial instruments.  Some investment banks also ignored the conflicts of interest 
created by their products, placed their financial interests before those of their clients, and even 
bet against the very securities they were recommending and marketing to their clients.  Together 
these factors produced a mortgage market saturated with high risk, poor quality mortgages and 
securities that, when they began incurring losses, caused financial institutions around the world 
to lose billions of dollars, produced rampant unemployment and foreclosures, and ruptured faith 
in U.S. capital markets.  

 
Nearly three years later, the U.S. economy has yet to recover from the damage caused by 

the 2008 financial crisis.  This Report is intended to help analysts, market participants, 
policymakers, and the public gain a deeper understanding of the origins of the crisis and take the 
steps needed to prevent excessive risk taking and conflicts of interest from causing similar 
damage in the future.  Each of the four chapters in this Report examining a key aspect of the 
financial crisis begins with specific findings of fact, details the evidence gathered by the 
Subcommittee, and ends with recommendations.  For ease of reference, all of the 
recommendations are reprinted here.  For more information about each recommendation, please 
see the relevant chapter. 

 

Recommendations on High Risk Lending 
 

1.  Ensure “Qualified Mortgages” Are Low Risk.  Federal regulators should use their 
regulatory authority to ensure that all mortgages deemed to be “qualified residential 
mortgages” have a low risk of delinquency or default.  

2.  Require Meaningful Risk Retention.  Federal regulators should issue a strong risk 
retention requirement under Section 941 by requiring the retention of not less than a 
5% credit risk in each, or a representative sample of, an asset backed securitization’s 
tranches, and by barring a hedging offset for a reasonable but limited period of time. 

3.  Safeguard Against High Risk Products.  Federal banking regulators should 
safeguard taxpayer dollars by requiring banks with high risk structured finance 
products, including complex products with little or no reliable performance data, to 
meet conservative loss reserve, liquidity, and capital requirements. 

 

 

13 

4.  Require Greater Reserves for Negative Amortization Loans.  Federal banking 
regulators should use their regulatory authority to require banks issuing negatively 
amortizing loans that allow borrowers to defer payments of interest and principal, to 
maintain more conservative loss, liquidity, and capital reserves.   

5.  Safeguard Bank Investment Portfolios.  Federal banking regulators should use the 
Section 620 banking activities study to identify high risk structured finance products 
and impose a reasonable limit on the amount of such high risk products that can be 
included in a bank’s investment portfolio. 

 

 

Recommendations on Regulatory Failures 
 

1.  Complete OTS Dismantling.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) 

should complete the dismantling of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), despite 
attempts by some OTS officials to preserve the agency’s identity and influence within 
the OCC. 

2.  Strengthen Enforcement.  Federal banking regulators should conduct a review of 

their major financial institutions to identify those with ongoing, serious deficiencies, 
and review their enforcement approach to those institutions to eliminate any policy of 
deference to bank management, inflated CAMELS ratings, or use of short term profits 
to excuse high risk activities.    

3.  Strengthen CAMELS Ratings.  Federal banking regulators should undertake a 

comprehensive review of the CAMELS ratings system to produce ratings that signal 
whether an institution is expected to operate in a safe and sound manner over a 
specified period of time, asset quality ratings that reflect embedded risks rather than 
short term profits, management ratings that reflect any ongoing failure to correct 
identified deficiencies, and composite ratings that discourage systemic risks. 

4.  Evaluate Impacts of High Risk Lending.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council 

should undertake a study to identify high risk lending practices at financial 
institutions, and evaluate the nature and significance of the impacts that these 
practices may have on U.S. financial systems as a whole.  

Recommendations on Inflated Credit Ratings 
 

1.  Rank Credit Rating Agencies by Accuracy.  The SEC should use its regulatory 

authority to rank the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations in terms 
of performance, in particular the accuracy of their ratings. 

   
2.  Help Investors Hold CRAs Accountable.  The SEC should use its regulatory 

authority to facilitate the ability of investors to hold credit rating agencies accountable 
in civil lawsuits for inflated credit ratings, when a credit rating agency knowingly or 
recklessly fails to conduct a reasonable investigation of the rated security. 

14 

3.  Strengthen CRA Operations.  The SEC should use its inspection, examination, and 
regulatory authority to ensure credit rating agencies institute internal controls, credit 
rating methodologies, and employee conflict of interest safeguards that advance 
rating accuracy. 

 
4.  Ensure CRAs Recognize Risk.  The SEC should use its inspection, examination, and 

regulatory authority to ensure credit rating agencies assign higher risk to financial 
instruments whose performance cannot be reliably predicted due to their novelty or 
complexity, or that rely on assets from parties with a record for issuing poor quality 
assets. 

 
5.  Strengthen Disclosure.  The SEC should exercise its authority under the new Section 

78o-7(s) of Title 15 to ensure that the credit rating agencies complete the required 
new ratings forms by the end of the year and that the new forms provide 
comprehensible, consistent, and useful ratings information to investors, including by 
testing the proposed forms with actual investors. 

6.   Reduce Ratings Reliance. Federal regulators should reduce the federal government’s 

reliance on privately issued credit ratings.  
 

Recommendations on Investment Bank Abuses   
 
 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

1. Review Structured Finance Transactions.  Federal regulators should review the 

RMBS, CDO, CDS, and ABX activities described in this Report to identify any 
violations of law and to examine ways to strengthen existing regulatory prohibitions 
against abusive practices involving structured finance products. 

2. Narrow Proprietary Trading Exceptions.  To ensure a meaningful ban on 

proprietary trading under Section 619, any exceptions to that ban, such as for market-
making or risk-mitigating hedging activities, should be strictly limited in the 
implementing regulations to activities that serve clients or reduce risk.   

3. Design Strong Conflict of Interest Prohibitions.  Regulators implementing the 

conflict of interest prohibitions in Sections 619 and 621 should consider the types of 
conflicts of interest in the Goldman Sachs case study, as identified in Chapter VI(C)(6) 
of this Report.   

4. Study Bank Use of Structured Finance.  Regulators conducting the banking 

activities study under Section 620 should consider the role of federally insured banks 
in designing, marketing, and investing in structured finance products with risks that 
cannot be reliably measured and naked credit default swaps or synthetic financial 
instruments.

Understanding the recent financial crisis requires examining how U.S. financial markets 

II.  BACKGROUND 
 
have changed in fundamental ways over the past 15 years.  The following provides a brief 
historical overview of some of those changes; explains some of the new financial products and 
trading strategies in the mortgage area; and provides background on credit ratings, investment 
banks, government sponsored enterprises, and financial regulators.  It also provides a brief 
timeline of key events in the financial crisis.  Two recurrent themes are the increasing amount of 
risk and conflicts of interest in U.S. financial markets. 

A.  Rise of Too-Big-To-Fail U.S. Financial Institutions 
Until relatively recently, federal and state laws limited federally-chartered banks from 
branching across state lines.2  Instead, as late as the 1990s, U.S. banking consisted primarily of 
thousands of modest-sized banks tied to local communities.  Since 1990, the United States has 
witnessed the number of regional and local banks and thrifts shrink from just over 15,000 to 
approximately 8,000 by 2009,3 while at the same time nearly 13,000 regional and local credit 
unions have been reduced to 7,500.4
suffered losses, the United States could quickly close its doors, protect its depositors, and avoid 
significant damage to the U.S. banking system or economy.  Decentralized banking also 
promoted competition, diffused credit in the marketplace, and prevented undue concentrations of 
financial power.  
 

  This broad-based approach meant that when a bank 

In the mid 1990s, the United States initiated substantial changes to the banking industry, 

 and exempted investment bank holding companies from direct federal 

some of which relaxed the rules under which banks operated, while others imposed new 
regulations, and still others encouraged increased risk-taking.  In 1994, for the first time, 
Congress explicitly authorized interstate banking, which allowed federally-chartered banks to 
open branches nationwide more easily than before.5  In 1999, Congress repealed the Glass-
Steagall Act of 1933, which had generally required banks, investment banks, securities firms, 
and insurance companies to operate separately,6 and instead allowed them to openly merge 
operations.7  The same law also eliminated the Glass-Steagall prohibition on banks engaging in 
proprietary trading8

time being Citicorp’s 1998 merger with the Travelers insurance group.

regulation.9  In 2000, Congress enacted the Commodity Futures Modernization Act which barred 
federal regulation of swaps and the trillion-dollar swap markets, and which allowed U.S. banks, 
broker-dealers, and other financial institutions to develop, market, and trade these unregulated 
financial products, including credit default swaps, foreign currency swaps, interest rate swaps, 
energy swaps, total return swaps, and more.10

   

 
In 2002, the Treasury Department, along with other federal bank regulatory agencies, 

altered the way capital reserves were calculated for banks, and encouraged the retention of 
securitized mortgages with investment grade credit ratings by allowing banks to hold less capital 
in reserve for them than if the individual mortgages were held directly on the banks’ books.11  In 
2004, the SEC relaxed the capital requirements for large broker-dealers, allowing them to grow 
even larger, often with borrowed funds.12  In 2005, when the SEC attempted to assert more 
control over the growing hedge fund industry, by requiring certain hedge funds to register with 
the agency, a federal Court of Appeals issued a 2006 opinion that invalidated the SEC 
regulation.13

 

 
These and other steps paved the way, over the course of little more than the last decade, 

for a relatively small number of U.S. banks and broker-dealers to become giant financial 
conglomerates involved in collecting deposits; financing loans; trading equities, swaps and 
commodities; and issuing, underwriting, and marketing billions of dollars in stock, debt 
instruments, insurance policies, and derivatives.  As these financial institutions grew in size and 
complexity, and began playing an increasingly important role in the U.S. economy, policymakers 
began to ask whether the failure of one of these financial institutions could damage not only the 
U.S. financial system, but the U.S. economy as a whole.  In a little over ten years, the creation of 
too-big-to-fail financial institutions had become a reality in the United States.14

in 2004, and terminated by the SEC in 2008, after the financial crisis.  The alternative net capital rules for broker-
dealers were terminated at the same time.

Over the last ten years, some U.S. financial institutions have not only grown larger and 

more complex, but have also engaged in higher risk activities.  The last decade has witnessed an 
explosion of so-called “innovative” financial products with embedded risks that are difficult to 
analyze and predict, including collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps, exchange 
traded funds, commodity and swap indices, and more.  Financial engineering produced these 
financial instruments which typically had little or no performance record to use for risk 
management purposes.  Some U.S. financial institutions became major participants in the 
development of these financial products, designing, selling, and trading them in U.S. and global 
markets.  
 

In addition, most major U.S. financial institutions began devoting increasing resources to 

so-called “proprietary trading,” in which the firm’s personnel used the firm’s capital to gain 
investment returns for the firm itself rather than for its clients.  Traditionally, U.S. banks, broker-
dealers, and investment banks had offered investment advice and services to their clients, and did 
well when their clients did well.  Over the last ten years, however, some firms began referring to 
their clients, not as customers, but as counterparties.  In addition, some firms at times developed 
and used financial products in transactions in which the firm did well only when its clients, or 
counterparties, lost money.  Some U.S. banks also sponsored affiliated hedge funds, provided 
them with billions of dollars in client and bank funds, and allowed the hedge funds to make high 
risk investments on the bank’s behalf, seeking greater returns.  

By 2005, as U.S. financial institutions reached unprecedented size and made increasing 

use of complex, high risk financial products, government oversight and regulation was 
increasingly incoherent and misguided.   

 
B.   High Risk Mortgage Lending 
The U.S. mortgage market reflected many of the trends affecting the U.S. financial 

system as a whole.  Prior to the early 1970s, families wishing to buy a home typically went to a 
local bank or mortgage company, applied for a loan and, after providing detailed financial 
information and a down payment, qualified for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage.  The local bank or 
mortgage company then typically kept that mortgage until the homeowner paid it off, earning its 
profit from the interest rates and fees paid by the borrower.  
 
which effectively limited the number of loans one bank could have on its books.  To increase 
their capital, some lenders began selling the loans on their books to other financial institutions 
that wanted to service the loans over time, and then used the profits to make new loans to 
prospective borrowers.  Lenders began to make money, not from holding onto the loans they 
originated and collecting mortgage payments over the years, but from the relatively short term 
fees associated with originating and selling the loans. 

Lenders were required to keep a certain amount of capital for each loan they issued, 

                                                                                                                                                                           
(8/28/2009).  Those banks plus Citigroup also issued one out of every two mortgages and two out of every three 
credit cards.  Id.   

18 

By 2003, many lenders began using higher risk lending strategies involving the 

origination and sale of complex mortgages that differed substantially from the traditional 30-year 
fixed rate home loan.  The following describes some of the securitization practices and higher 
risk mortgage products that came to dominate the mortgage market in the years leading up to the 
financial crisis.  

Securitization.  To make home loans sales more efficient and profitable, banks began 

making increasing use of a mechanism now called “securitization.”  In a securitization, a 
financial institution bundles a large number of home loans into a loan pool, and calculates the 
amount of mortgage payments that will be paid into that pool by the borrowers.  The securitizer 
then forms a shell corporation or trust, often offshore, to hold the loan pool and use the mortgage 
revenue stream to support the creation of bonds that make payments to investors over time.  
Those bonds, which are registered with the SEC, are called residential mortgage backed 
securities (RMBS) and are typically sold in a public offering to investors.  Investors typically 
make a payment up front, and then hold onto the RMBS securities which repay the principal plus 
interest over time.  The amount of money paid periodically to the RMBS holders is often referred 
to as the RMBS “coupon rate.”  

For years, securitization worked well.  Borrowers paid their 30-year, fixed rate mortgages 

with few defaults, and mortgage backed securities built up a reputation as a safe investment.  
Lenders earned fees for bundling the home loans into pools and either selling the pools or 
securitizing them into mortgage backed securities.  Investment banks also earned fees from 
working with the lenders to assemble the pools, design the mortgage backed securities, obtain 
credit ratings for them, and sell the resulting securities to investors.  Investors like pension funds, 
insurance companies, municipalities, university endowments, and hedge funds earned a 
reasonable rate of return on the RMBS securities they purchased.     

Due to the 2002 Treasury rule that reduced capital reserves for securitized mortgages, 

RMBS holdings also became increasingly attractive to banks, which could determine how much 
capital they needed to hold based on the credit ratings their RMBS securities received from the 
credit ratings agencies.  According to economist Arnold Kling, among other problems, the 2002 
rule “created opportunities for banks to lower their ratio of capital to assets through structured 
financing” and “created the incentive for rating agencies to provide overly optimistic assessment 
of the risk in mortgage pools.”15
 
joined with Wall Street’s growing appetite for securitization fees, prompted lenders to issue 
mortgages not only to well qualified borrowers, but also higher risk borrowers.  Higher risk 
borrowers were often referred to as “subprime” borrowers to distinguish them from the more 
creditworthy “prime” borrowers who traditionally qualified for home loans.  Some lenders began 

High Risk Mortgages.  The resulting increased demand for mortgage backed securities,

to specialize in issuing loans to subprime borrowers and became known as subprime lenders.16
Subprime loans provided new fuel for the securitization engines on Wall Street. 
 
Federal law does not define subprime loans or subprime borrowers, but in 2001, guidance 
issued by federal banking regulators defined subprime borrowers as those with certain credit risk 
characteristics, including one or more of the following:  (1) two or more 30-day delinquencies in 
the last 12 months, or one or more 60-day delinquencies in the last 24 months; (2) a judgment or 
foreclosure in the prior 24 months; (3) a bankruptcy in the last five years; (4) a relatively high 
default probability as evidenced by, for example, a credit score below 660 on the FICO scale; or 
(5) a debt service-to-income ratio of 50% or more.
definition to any borrower with a credit score below 660 or even 620 on the FICO scale;18 while 
still others failed to institute any explicit definition of a subprime borrower or loan.19  Credit 
scores are an underwriting tool used by lenders to evaluate the likelihood that a particular 
individual will repay his or her debts.  FICO credit scores, developed by the Fair Issacs 
Corporation, are the most widely used credit scores in U.S. financial markets and provide scores 
ranging from 300 to 850, with the higher scores indicating greater creditworthiness.20

High risk loans were not confined, however, to those issued to subprime borrowers.  

Some lenders engaged in a host of risky lending practices that allowed them to quickly generate 
a large volume of high risk loans to both subprime and prime borrowers.  Those practices, for 
example, required little or no verification of borrower income, required borrowers to provide 
little or no down payments, and used loans in which the borrower was not required to pay down 
the loan amount, and instead incurred added debt over time, known as “negative amortization” 
loans.  Some lenders offered a low initial “teaser rate,” followed by a higher interest rate that

credit information to identify factors that can reliably be used to predict whether an individual will repay outstanding 
debt.  Key factors in the FICO score include an individual’s overall level of debt, payment history, types of credit 
extensions, and use of available credit lines.  See “What’s in Your FICO Score,” Fair Isaac Corporation,

developed, including the VantageScore developed jointly by the three major credit bureaus, Equifax Inc., Experian 
Group Ltd., and TransUnion LLC, but the FICO score remains the most widely used credit score in U.S. financial 
markets.

took effect after a specified event or period of time, to enable borrowers with less income to 
make the initial, smaller loan payments.  Some qualified borrowers according to whether they 
could afford to pay the lower initial rate, rather than the higher rate that took effect later, 
expanding the number of borrowers who could qualify for the loans.  Some lenders deliberately 
issued loans that made economic sense for borrowers only if the borrowers could refinance the 
loan within a few years to retain the teaser rate, or sell the home to cover the loan costs.  Some 
lenders also issued loans that depended upon the mortgaged home to increase in value over time, 
and cover the loan costs if the borrower defaulted.  Still another risky practice engaged in by 
some lenders was to ignore signs of loan fraud and to issue and securitize loans suspected of 
containing fraudulent borrower information. 

These practices were used to qualify borrowers for larger loans than they could have 

otherwise obtained.  When borrowers took out larger loans, the mortgage broker typically 
profited from higher fees and commissions; the lender profited from higher fees and a better 
price for the loan on the secondary market; and Wall Street firms profited from a larger revenue 
stream to support bigger pools of mortgage backed securities.   

The securitization of higher risk loans led to increased profits, but also injected greater 

  Because higher risk loans required 

risks into U.S. mortgage markets.  Some U.S. lenders, like Washington Mutual and Countrywide, 
made wholesale shifts in their loan programs, reducing their sale of low risk, 30-year, fixed rate 
mortgages and increasing their sale of higher risk loans.21
borrowers to pay higher fees and a higher rate of interest, they produced greater initial profits for 
lenders than lower risk loans.  In addition, Wall Street firms were willing to pay more for the 
higher risk loans, because once securitized, the AAA securities relying on those loans typically 
paid investors a higher rate of return than other AAA investments, due to the higher risk 
involved.  As a result, investors were willing to pay more, and mortgaged backed securities 
relying on higher risk loans typically fetched a better price than those relying on lower risk loans.  
Lenders also incurred little risk from issuing the higher risk loans, since they quickly sold the 
loans and kept the risk off their books.  
 
After 2000, the number of high risk loans increased rapidly, from about $125 billion in 
dollar value or 12% of all U.S. loan originations in 2000, to about $1 trillion in dollar value or

about 14.5 million high risk loans.23

“refinanced their mortgages at a higher amount than the loan balance to convert their 
home equity into money for personal use (known as ‘cash-out refinancing’).  Of the 
subprime mortgages originated from 2000 through 2007, 55 percent were for cash-out 
refinancing, 9 percent were for no-cash-out refinancing, and 36 percent were for a home 
purchase.”
Some lenders became known inside the industry for issuing high risk, poor quality loans, 
yet during the years leading up to the financial crisis were able to securitize and sell their home 
loans with few problems.  Subprime lenders like Long Beach Mortgage Corporation, New 
Century Financial Corporation, and Fremont Loan & Investment, for example, were known for 
issuing poor quality subprime loans.
  Despite their reputations for poor quality loans, leading 
investment banks continued to do business with them and helped them sell or securitize hundreds 
of billions of dollars in home mortgages. 

 

26

These three lenders and others issued a variety of nontraditional, high risk loans whose 
subsequent delinquencies and defaults later contributed to the financial crisis.  They included 
hybrid adjustable rate mortgages, pick-a-payment or option ARM loans, interest-only loans, 
home equity loans, and Alt A and stated income loans.  Although some of these loans had been 
in existence for years, they had previously been restricted to a relatively small group of 
borrowers who were generally able to repay their debts.  In the years leading up to the financial 
crisis, however, lenders issued these higher risk loans to a wide variety of borrowers, including 
subprime borrowers, who often used them to purchase more expensive homes than they would 
have been able to buy using traditional fixed rate, 30-year loans.     

Hybrid ARMs.  One common high risk loan used by lenders in the years leading up to 

the financial crisis was the short term hybrid adjustable rate mortgage (Hybrid ARM), which was 
offered primarily to subprime borrowers.  From 2000 to 2007, about 70% of subprime loans 
were Hybrid ARMs.27
  Hybrid ARMs were often referred to “2/28,” “3/27,” or “5/25” loans.  
These 30-year mortgages typically had a low fixed teaser rate, which then reset to a higher 
floating interest rate, after two years for the 2/28, three years for the 3/27, or five years for the 
5/25.  The initial loan payment was typically calculated by assuming the initial low, fixed 
interest rate would be used to pay down the loan.  In some cases, the loan used payments that 
initially covered only the interest due on the loan and not any principal; these loans were called 
“interest only” loans.  After the fixed period for the teaser rate expired, the monthly payment was 
typically recalculated using the higher floating rate to pay off the remaining principal and interest 
owing over the course of the remaining loan period.  The resulting monthly payment was much

larger and sometimes caused borrowers to experience “payment shock” and default on their 
loans.  To avoid the higher interest rate and the larger loan payment, many of the borrowers 
routinely refinanced their loans; when those borrowers were unable to refinance, many were 
unable to afford the higher mortgage payment and defaulted.   

Pick-A-Payment or Option ARMs.  Another common high risk loan, offered to both 
prime and subprime borrowers during the years leading up to the financial crisis, was known as 
the “pick-a-payment” or “option adjustable rate mortgage” (Option ARM).  According to a 2009 
GAO report: 

“[P]ayment-option ARMs were once specialized products for financially sophisticated 
borrowers but ultimately became more widespread.  According to federal banking 
regulators and a range of industry participants, as home prices increased rapidly in some 
areas of the country, lenders began marketing payment-option ARMs as affordability 
products and made them available to less-creditworthy and lower-income borrowers.”28
 
Option ARMs typically allowed the borrower to pay an initial low teaser rate, sometimes 

as low as a 1% annual rate for the first month, and then imposed a much higher interest rate 
linked to an index, while also giving the borrower a choice each month of how much to pay 
down the outstanding loan balance.  These loans were called “pick-a-payment” or “option” 
ARMs, because borrowers were typically allowed to choose among four alternatives:  (1) paying 
the fully amortizing amount needed to pay off the loan in 30 years; (2) paying an even higher 
amount to pay off the loan in 15 years; (3) paying only the interest owed that month and no 
principal; or (4) making a “minimum” payment that covered only a portion of the interest owed 
and none of the principal.  If the minimum payment option were selected, the unpaid interest 
would be added to the loan principal.  If, each month, the borrower made only the minimum 
payment, the loan principal would increase rather than decrease over time, creating a negatively 
amortizing loan. 

Typically, after five years or when the loan principal reached a designated threshold, such 

as 110%, 115%, or 125% of the original loan amount, the loan would “recast.”  The borrower 
would then be required to make the fully amortizing payment needed to pay off the remaining 
loan amount within the remaining loan period.  The new monthly payment amount was typically 
much greater, causing payment shock and increasing loan defaults.  For example, a borrower 
taking out a $400,000 loan, with a teaser rate of 1.5% and subsequent interest rate of 6%, might 
have a minimum payment of $1,333.  If the borrower then made only the minimum payments 
until the loan recast, the new payment using the 6% rate would be $2,786, an increase of more 
than 100%.  What began as a 30-year loan for $400,000 became a 25-year loan for $432,000.  To 
avoid having the loan recast, option ARM borrowers typically sought to refinance their loans.  At 
some lenders, a significant portion of their option ARM business consisted of refinancing 
existing loans.   

Home Equity Loans.  A third type of high risk loan that became popular during the 

years leading up to the financial crisis was the home equity loan (HEL).  HELs provided loans 

                                                      
287/28/2009 “Characteristics and Performance of Nonprime Mortgages,” GAO, Report No. GAO-09-848R at 12-13. 

23 

secured by the borrower’s equity in his or her home, which served as the loan collateral.  HELs 
typically provided a lump sum loan amount that had to be repaid over a fixed period of time, 
such as 5, 10, or 30 years, using a fixed interest rate, although adjustable rates could also be 
used.  A related loan, the Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), created a revolving line of 
credit, secured by the borrower’s home, that the borrower could use at will, to take out and repay 
various levels of debt over time, typically using an adjustable rate of interest.  Both HELs and 
HELOCs created liens against the borrower’s house which, in the event of a default, could be 
sold to repay any outstanding loan amounts.   

During the years leading up to the financial crisis, lenders provided HELs and HELOCs 
to both prime and subprime borrowers.  They were typically high risk loans, because most were 
issued to borrowers who already had a mortgage on their homes and held only a limited amount 
of equity.  The HEL or HELOC was typically able to establish only a “second lien” or “second 
mortgage” on the property.  If the borrower later defaulted and the home sold, the sale proceeds 
would be used to pay off the primary mortgage first, and only then the HEL or HELOC.  Often, 
the sale proceeds were insufficient to repay the HEL or HELOC loan.  In addition, some lenders 
created home loan programs in which a HEL was issued as a “piggyback loan” to the primary 
home mortgage to finance all or part of the borrower’s down payment.29  Taken together, the 
HEL and the mortgage often provided the borrower with financing equal to 85%, 90%, or even 
100% of the property’s value.30
  The resulting high loan-to-value ratio, and the lack of borrower 
equity in the home, meant that, if the borrower defaulted and the home had to be sold, the sale 
proceeds were unlikely to be sufficient to repay both loans. 

Alt A Loans.  Another type of common loan during the years leading up to the financial 

crisis was the “Alt A” loan.  Alt A loans were issued to borrowers with relatively good credit 
31  For example, Alt 
histories, but with aggressive underwriting that increased the risk of the loan.
A loans often allowed borrowers to obtain 100% financing of their homes, to have an unusually 
high debt-to-income ratio, or submit limited or even no documentation to establish their income 
levels.  Alt A loans were sometimes referred to as “low doc” or “no doc” loans.  They were 
originally developed for self employed individuals who could not easily establish their income 
by producing traditional W-2 tax return forms or pay stubs, and so were allowed to submit 
“alternative” documentation to establish their income or assets, such as bank statements.32  The 
reasoning was that other underwriting criteria could be used to ensure that Alt A loans would be 
repaid, such as selecting only borrowers with a high credit score or with a property appraisal 
showing the home had substantial value in excess of the loan amount.  According to GAO, from 
2000 to 2006, the percentage of Alt A loans with less than full documentation of the borrower’s 
income or assets rose from about 60% to 80%.33

30 Id.  GAO determined that, in 2000, only about 2.4% of subprime loans had a combined loan-to-value ratio, 
including both first and second home liens, of 100%, but by 2006, the percentage had climbed tenfold to 29.3%.

Option ARMs as a separate loan category.

24 

Stated Income Loans.  Stated income loans were a more extreme form of low doc Alt A 
loans, in that they imposed no documentation requirements and required little effort by the lender 
to verify the borrower’s income.  These loans allowed borrowers simply to “state” their income, 
with no verification by the lender of the borrower’s income or assets other than to consider the 
income’s “reasonableness.”  They were sometimes called “NINA” loans, because “No Income” 
and “No Assets” of the borrower were verified by the lender.  They were also referred to as “liar 
loans,” since borrowers could lie about their incomes, and the lender would make little effort to 
substantiate the claimed income.  Many lenders believed they could simply rely on the other 
underwriting tools, such as the borrower’s credit score and the property appraisal, to ensure the 
loans would be repaid.  Once rare and reserved only for wealthier borrowers, stated income loans 
became commonplace in the years leading up to the financial crisis.  For example, at Washington 
Mutual Bank, one of the case studies in this Report, by the end of 2007, stated income loans 
made up 50% of its subprime loans, 73% of its Option ARMs, and 90% of its home equity 
loans.34

  

Nationwide, the percentage of high risk loans issued with low or no documentation of 
borrower income or assets was less dramatic.  According to GAO, for example, from 2000 to 
2006, the nationwide percentage of subprime loans with low or no documentation of borrower 
income or assets grew from about 20% to 38%.

35

 

Volume and Speed.  When lenders kept on their books the loans they issued, the 

creditworthiness of those loans determined whether the lender would turn a profit.  Once lenders 
began to sell or securitize most of their loans, volume and speed, as opposed to creditworthiness, 
became the keys to a profitable securitization business.   

In addition, in the years leading up to the financial crisis, investors that might normally 

insist on purchasing only high quality securities, purchased billions of dollars in RMBS 
securities containing poor quality, high risk loans, in part because those securities bore AAA 
ratings from the credit rating agencies, and in part because the securities offered higher returns 
compared to other AAA rated investments.  Banks also bought investment grade RMBS 
securities to take advantage of their lower capital requirements.  Increasingly, the buyers of 
RMBS securities began to forego detailed due diligence of the RMBS securities they purchased.  
Instead, they, like the lenders issuing the mortgages, operated in a mortgage market that came to 
be dominated by volume and speed, as opposed to credit risk.   

Lenders that produced a high volume of loans could sell pools of the loans to Wall Street 

or to government sponsored entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Likewise, they could 
securitize the loans and work with Wall Street investment banks to sell the securities to investors.  
These lenders passed on the risk of nonpayment to third parties, and so lost interest in whether 
the sold loans would, in fact, be repaid.  Investment banks that securitized the loans garnered 
fees for their services and also typically passed on the risk of nonpayment to the investors who

bought the mortgage backed securities.  The investment banks were typically interested in loan 
repayment rates only to the extent needed to ensure defaulting loans did not cause losses to the 
mortgage backed securities they sold.  Even some of the investors who purchased the mortgage 
backed securities lost interest in their creditworthiness, so long as they could buy “insurance” in 
the form of credit default swaps that paid off if a mortgage backed security defaulted.   

To ensure an ongoing supply of loans for sale, lenders created compensation incentives 

that encouraged their personnel to quickly produce a high volume of loans.  They also 
encouraged their staffs to issue or purchase higher risk loans, because those loans produced 
higher sale prices on Wall Street.  Loan officers, for example, received more money per loan for 
originating higher risk loans and for exceeding established loan targets.  Loan processing 
personnel were compensated according to the speed and number of the loans they processed.  
Loan officers and their sales associates received still more compensation, often called yield 
spread premiums, if they charged borrowers higher interest rates or points than required in the 
lender’s rate sheets specifying loan prices, or included prepayment penalties in the loan 
agreements.  The Subcommittee’s investigation found that lenders employed few compensation 
incentives to encourage loan officers or loan processors to produce high quality, creditworthy 
loans in line with the lender’s credit requirements. 

As long as home prices kept rising, the high risk loans fueling the securitization markets 

produced few problems.  Borrowers who could not make their loan payments could refinance 
their loans or sell their homes and use the sale proceeds to pay off their mortgages.  As this chart 
shows, over the ten years before the crisis hit, housing prices shot up faster than they had in 
decades, allowing price increases to mask problems with the high risk loans being issued.36

Borrowers were able to pay for the increasingly expensive homes, in part, because of the 
exotic, high risk loans and lax loan underwriting practices that allowed them to buy more house 
than they could really afford.   

C.  Credit Ratings and Structured Finance  
Despite the increasing use of high risk loans to support mortgage related securities, 

mortgage related securities continued to receive AAA and other investment grade ratings from 
the credit rating agencies, indicating they were judged to be safe investments.  Those credit 
ratings gave a sense of security to investors and enabled investors like pension funds, insurance 
companies, university endowments, and municipalities, which were often required to hold safe 
investments, to continue to purchase mortgage related securities.   
 
Credit Ratings Generally.  A credit rating is an assessment of the likelihood that a 
particular financial instrument, such as a corporate bond or mortgage backed security, may

default or incur losses.37
repaid and so qualifies as a safe investment.  

  A high credit rating indicates that a debt instrument is expected to be

Credit ratings are issued by private firms that have been officially designated by the SEC 

    Financial instruments bearing AAA through BBB- ratings are generally 

Credit ratings use a scale of letter grades to indicate credit risk, ranging from AAA to D, 

as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs).  NRSROs are usually 
referred to as “credit rating agencies.”  While there are ten registered credit rating agencies in the 
United States, the market is dominated by just three:  Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. 
38  
(Moody’s); Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P); and Fitch Ratings Ltd. (Fitch).
By some accounts, these firms issue about 98% of the total credit ratings and collect 90% of total 
credit rating revenue in the United States.39
 
with AAA ratings designating the safest investments.  Investments with AAA ratings have 
historically had low default rates.  For example, S&P reported that its cumulative RMBS default 
rate by original rating class (through September 15, 2007) was 0.04% for AAA initial ratings and 
1.09% for BBB.
referred to as “investment grade,” while those with ratings below BBB- (or Baa3) are referred to 
as “below investment grade” or sometimes as having “junk” status.  Financial instruments that 
default receive a D rating from Standard & Poor’s, but no rating at all from Moody’s. 
 
Investors often rely on credit ratings to gauge the safety of a particular investment.  Some 
institutional investors design an investment strategy that calls for acquiring assets with specified 
credit ratings.  State and federal law also restricts the amount of below investment grade bonds 
that certain investors can hold, such as pension funds and insurance companies.
limited by law in the amount of noninvestment grade bonds they can hold, and are typically 
required to post additional capital for investments carrying riskier ratings.  Because so many 
federal and state statutes and regulations required financial institutions to hold securities with 
investment grade ratings, the credit rating agencies were not only guaranteed a steady business, 
but were encouraged to issue AAA and other investment grade ratings.  Issuers of securities and 
other financial instruments also worked hard to obtain favorable credit ratings to ensure more 
investors could buy their products.

bonds from Enron Corporation and other troubled corporations, Congress strengthened the 
SEC’s authority over the credit rating industry.  Among other provisions, the law established 
criteria for the NRSRO designation and authorized the SEC to conduct examinations of credit 
rating agencies.  The law also, however, prohibited the SEC from regulating credit rating criteria 
or methodologies used in credit rating models.  In June 2007, the SEC issued implementing 
regulations, which were essentially too late to affect the ratings already provided for mortgage 
related securities.  One month later, in July 2007, the credit rating agencies issued the first of 
several mass downgrades of the ratings earlier issued for mortgage related securities.  

Structured Finance.  In recent years, Wall Street firms have devised increasingly 

complex financial instruments for sale to investors.  These instruments are often referred to as 
structured finance.  Because structured finance products are so complicated and opaque, 
investors often place particular reliance on credit ratings to determine whether they should buy 
them.   

 
Among the oldest types of structured finance products are RMBS securities.  To create 

these securities, issuers – often working with investment banks – bundle large numbers of home 
loans into a loan pool, and calculate the revenue stream coming into the loan pool from the 
individual mortgages.  They then design a “waterfall” that delivers a stream of revenues in 
sequential order to specified “tranches.”  The first tranche is at the top of the waterfall and is 
typically the first to receive revenues from the mortgage pool.  Since that tranche is guaranteed 
to be paid first, it is the safest investment in the pool.  The issuer creates a security, often called a 
bond, linked to that first tranche.  That security typically receives a AAA credit rating since its 
revenue stream is the most secure.     

 
The security created from the next tranche receives the same or a lower credit rating and 
so on until the waterfall reaches the “equity” tranche at the bottom.  The equity tranche typically 
receives no rating since it is the last to be paid, and therefore the first to incur losses if mortgages 
in the loan pool default.  Since virtually every mortgage pool has at least some mortgages that 
default, equity tranches are intended to provide loss protection for the tranches above it.  Because 
equity tranches are riskier, however, they are often assigned and receive a higher rate of interest 
and can be profitable if losses are minimal.  One mortgage pool might produce five to a dozen or 
more tranches, each of which is used to create a residential mortgage backed security that is rated 
and then sold to investors. 

 
Cash CDOs.  Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are another type of structured 
finance product whose securities receive credit ratings and are sold to investors.  CDOs are a 
more complex financial product that involves the re-securitization of existing income-producing 
assets.  From 2004 through 2007, many CDOs included RMBS securities from multiple 
mortgage pools.  For example, a CDO might contain BBB rated securities from 100 different 
RMBS securitizations.  CDOs can also contain other types of assets, such as commercial 
mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds, or other CDO securities.  These CDOs are often 
called “cash CDOs,” because they receive cash revenues from the underlying RMBS bonds and 
other assets.  If a CDO is designed so that it contains a specific list of assets that do not change, it 
is often called a “static” CDO; if the CDO’s assets are allowed to change over time, it is often 

29 

referred to as a “managed” CDO.  Like an RMBS securitization, the CDO arranger calculates the 
revenue stream coming into the pool of assets, designs a waterfall to divide those incoming 
revenues among a hierarchy of tranches, and uses each tranche to issue securities that can then be 
marketed to investors.  The most senior tranches of a CDO may receive AAA ratings, even if all 
of its underlying assets have BBB ratings. 

   
Synthetic CDOs.  Some investment banks also created “synthetic CDOs” which 

mimicked cash CDOs, but did not contain actual mortgages or other assets that produced income.  
Instead, they simply “referenced” existing assets and then allowed investors to use credit default 
swaps to place bets on the performance of those referenced assets.  Investors who bet that the 
referenced assets would maintain or increase in value bought the CDO’s securities and, in 
exchange, received periodic coupon payments to recoup their principal investment plus interest.  
Investors who bet that the referenced assets would lose value or incur a specified negative credit 
event purchased one or more credit default swap contracts referencing the CDO’s assets, and 
paid monthly premiums to the CDO in exchange for obtaining a large lump sum payment if the 
loss or other negative credit event actually occurred.  Investors in synthetic CDOs who bet the 
referenced assets would maintain or increase in value were said to be on the “long” side, while 
investors who bet the assets would lose value or fail were said to be on the “short” side.  Some 
investment banks also created “hybrid CDOs” which contained some cash assets as well as credit 
default swaps referencing other assets.  Others created financial instruments called CDO squared 
or cubed, which contained or referenced tranches from other CDOs.   

 
 Like RMBS mortgage pools and cash CDOs, synthetic and hybrid CDOs pooled the 

payments they received, designed a waterfall assigning portions of the revenues to tranches set 
up in a certain order, created securities linked to the various tranches, and then sold the CDO 
securities to investors.  Some CDOs employed a “portfolio selection agent” to select the initial 
assets for the CDO.  In addition, some CDOs employed a “collateral manager” to select both the 
initial and subsequent assets that went into the CDO.   
 

Ratings Used to Market RMBS and CDOs.  Wall Street firms helped design RMBS 
and CDO securities, worked with the credit rating agencies to obtain ratings for the securities, 
and sold the securities to investors like pension funds, insurance companies, university 
endowments, municipalities, and hedge funds.  Without investment grade ratings, Wall Street 
firms would have had a more difficult time selling structured finance products to investors, 
because each investor would have had to perform its own due diligence review of the product.  In 
addition, their sales would have been restricted by federal and state regulations limiting certain 
institutional investors to the purchase of instruments carrying investment grade credit ratings.  
Still other regulations conditioned capital reserve requirements on the credit ratings assigned to a 
bank’s investments.  Investment grade credit ratings, thus, purported to simplify the investors’ 
due diligence review, ensured some investors could make a purchase, reduced banks’ capital 
calls, and otherwise enhanced the sales of the structured finance products.  Here’s how one 
federal bank regulator’s handbook put it: 

 
“The rating agencies perform a critical role in structured finance – evaluating the credit 
quality of the transactions. Such agencies are considered credible because they possess 

30 

the expertise to evaluate various underlying asset types, and because they do not have a 
financial interest in a security’s cost or yield.  Ratings are important because investors 
generally accept ratings by the major public rating agencies in lieu of conducting a due 
diligence investigation of the underlying assets and the servicer.”42

 

The more complex and opaque the structured finance instruments became, the more reliant 
investors were on high credit ratings for the instruments to be marketable.  
  

In addition to making structured finance products easier to sell to investors, Wall Street 
firms  used  financial  engineering  to  combine  AAA  ratings  –  normally  reserved  for  ultra-safe 
investments with low rates of return – with high risk assets, such as the AAA tranche from a 
subprime RMBS paying a relatively high rate of return.  Higher rates of return, combined with 
AAA ratings, made subprime RMBS and related CDOs especially attractive investments. 

 

Record Ratings and Revenues. From 2004 to 2007, Moody’s and S&P produced a record 

number of ratings and a record amount of revenues for rating structured finance products.  A 
2008 S&P submission to the SEC indicates, for example, that from 2004 to 2007, S&P issued 
more than 5,500 RMBS ratings and more than 835 mortgage related CDO ratings.43  According 
to a 2008 Moody’s submission to the SEC, from 2004 to 2007, Moody’s issued over 4,000 
RMBS ratings and over 870 CDO ratings.44

   

Revenues increased dramatically over the same time period.  The credit rating agencies 
charged substantial fees to rate a product.  To obtain a rating during the height of the market, for 
example, S&P generally charged from $40,000 to $135,000 to rate tranches of an RMBS and 
45  Surveillance fees generally ranged 
from $30,000 to $750,000 to rate the tranches of a CDO.
from $5,000 to $50,000 per year for mortgage backed securities.46  Over a five-year period, 
Moody’s gross revenues from RMBS and CDO ratings more than tripled, going from over $61 
million in 2002, to over $260 million in 2006.47
  S&P’s revenue also increased.  S&P’s gross 
revenues for RMBS and mortgage related CDO ratings quadrupled, from over $64 million in

Conflicts of Interest.  Credit rating agencies are paid by the issuers seeking ratings for 

the products they sell.  Issuers and the investment banks want high ratings, whether to help 
market their products or ensure they comply with federal regulations.  Because credit rating 
agencies issue ratings to issuers and investment banks who bring them business, they are subject 
to an inherent conflict of interest that can create pressure on the credit rating agencies to issue 
favorable ratings to attract business.  The issuers and investment banks engage in “ratings 
shopping,” choosing the credit rating agency that offers the highest ratings.  Ratings shopping 
weakens rating standards as the rating agencies who provide the most favorable ratings win more 
business.  In September 2007, Moody’s CEO described the problem this way:  “What happened 
in ’04 and ’05 with respect to subordinated tranches is that our competition, Fitch and S&P, went 
nuts.  Everything was investment grade.”
conflicts of interest faced by credit rating agencies have increased in recent years, particularly 
given the expansion of large credit rating agencies into ancillary advisory and other businesses, 
and the continued rise in importance of rating agencies in the U.S. securities markets.”51
 
Mass Downgrades.    The credit ratings assigned to RMBS and CDO securities are 
designed to last the lifetime of the securities.  Because circumstances can change, however, 
credit rating agencies conduct ongoing surveillance of each rated financial product to evaluate 
the rating and determine whether it should be upgraded or downgraded.  Prior to the financial 
crisis, the numbers of downgrades and upgrades for structured finance ratings were substantially 
lower.

Moody’s and S&P began downgrading RMBS and CDO products in late 2006, when 
residential mortgage delinquency rates and losses began increasing.  Then, in July 2007, both 
S&P and Moody’s initiated the first of several mass downgrades that shocked the financial 
markets.  On July 10, S&P placed on credit watch the ratings of 612 subprime RMBS with an 
original value of $7.35 billion. Later that day, Moody’s downgraded 399 subprime RMBS with 
an original value of $5.2 billion. Two days later, S&P downgraded 498 of the ratings it had 
placed on credit watch.   

 
In October 2007, Moody’s began downgrading CDOs on a daily basis, downgrading 

more than 270 CDO securities with an original value of $10 billion.  In December 2007, 
Moody’s downgraded another $14 billion in CDOs, and placed another $105 billion on credit 
watch.  Moody’s calculated that, overall in 2007, “8725 ratings from 2116 deals were 
downgraded and 1954 ratings from 732 deals were upgraded,”55 which means that it downgraded 
over four times more ratings than it upgraded.  On January 30, 2008, S&P either downgraded or 
placed on credit watch over 8,200 ratings of subprime RMBS and CDO securities, representing 
issuance amounts of approximately $270.1 billion and $263.9 billion, respectively.56

   

 
These downgrades created significant turmoil in the securitization markets, as investors 

were required by regulations to sell off assets that had lost their investment grade status, holdings 
at financial firms plummeted in value, and new securitizations were unable to find investors.  As 
a result, the subprime RMBS and CDO secondary markets slowed and then collapsed, and 
financial firms around the world were left holding billions of dollars in suddenly unmarketable 
RMBS and CDO securities.    

 
D.  Investment Banks 
Historically, investment banks helped raise capital for business and other endeavors by 
helping to design, finance, and sell financial products like stocks or bonds.  When a corporation 
needed capital to fund a large construction project, for example, it often hired an investment 
bank either to help it arrange a bank loan or raise capital by helping to market a new issue of 
shares or corporate bonds to investors.  Investment banks also helped with corporate mergers and 
acquisitions.  Today, investment banks also participate in a wide range of other financial 
activities, including offering broker-dealer and investment advisory services, and trading 
derivatives and commodities.  Many have also been active in the mortgage market and have 
worked with lenders or mortgage brokers to package and sell mortgage loans and mortgage 
backed securities.  Investment banks have traditionally performed these services in exchange for 
fees.

If an investment bank agreed to act as an “underwriter” for the issuance of a new security 

to the public, it typically bore the risk of those securities on its books until the securities were 
sold.  By law, securities sold to the public generally must be registered with the SEC.57  
Registration statements explain the purpose of a proposed public offering, an issuer’s operations 
and management, key financial data, and other important facts to potential investors.  Any 
offering document or prospectus provided to the investing public must also be filed with the 
SEC.  If an issuer decides not to offer a new security to the general public, it can still offer it to 
investors through a “private placement.”58  Investment banks often act as the “placement agent” 
in these private offerings, helping to design, market, and sell the security to selected investors.  
Solicitation documents in connection with private placements are not required to be filed with 
the SEC.  Under the federal securities laws, however, investment banks that act as an underwriter 
or placement agent may be liable for any material misrepresentations or omissions of material 
facts made in connection with a solicitation or sale of a security to an investor.59

 
In the years leading up to the financial crisis, RMBS securities were generally registered 
with the SEC and sold in public offerings, while CDO securities were generally sold to investors 
through private placements.  Investment banks frequently served as the underwriter or placement 
agent in those transactions, and typically sold both types of securities to large institutional 
investors.  

 
In addition to arranging for a public or private offering, some investment banks take on 
the role of a “market maker,” standing willing and able to buy or sell financial products to their 
clients or other market participants.  To facilitate client orders to buy or sell those products, the 
investment bank may acquire an inventory of them and make them available for client 
transactions.60
the financial products and make it easier and more attractive for clients to buy and sell them.  
Market makers typically rely on fees in the form of markups in the price of the financial products 
for their profits. 

  By filling both buy and sell orders, market makers help create a liquid market for 

 
At the same time, investment banks may decide to buy and sell the financial products for 

their own account, which is called “proprietary trading.”  Investment banks often use the same 
inventory of financial products to carry out both their market making and proprietary trading 
activities.  Investment banks that trade for their own account typically rely on changes in the 
values of the financial products to turn a profit.   

 
Inventories that are used for market making and short term proprietary trading purposes 
are typically designated as a portfolio of assets “held for sale.” Investment banks also typically 
maintain an inventory or portfolio of assets that they intend to keep as long term investments.

This inventory or portfolio of long-term assets is typically designated as “held for investment,” 
and is not used in day-to-day transactions.  

 
Investment banks that carry out market-making and proprietary trading activities are 

required  – by their banking regulator in the case of banks and bank holding companies61 and by 
the SEC in the case of broker-dealers62
capital to meet their regulatory requirements and financial obligations.  These capital 
requirements typically vary based on how the positions are held and how they are classified.  For 
example, assets that are “held for sale” or are in the “trading account” typically have lower 
capital requirements than those that are “held for investment,” because of the expected lower 
risks associated with what are expected to be shorter term holdings. 

  – to track their investments and maintain sufficient 

   
Many investment banks use complex automated systems to analyze the “Value at Risk” 
(VaR) associated with their holdings.  To reduce the VaR attached to their holdings, investment 
banks employ a variety of methods to offset or “hedge” their risk.  These methods can include 
diversifying their assets, taking a short position on related financial products, purchasing loss 
protection through insurance or credit default swaps, or taking positions in derivatives whose 
values move inversely to the value of the assets being hedged. 
 

Shorting the Mortgage Market.  Prior to the financial crisis, investors commonly 

purchased RMBS or CDO securities as long-term investments that produced a steady income.  In 
2006, however, the high risk mortgages underlying these securities began to incur record levels 
of delinquencies.  Some investors, worried about the value of their holdings, sought to sell their 
RMBS or CDO securities, but had a difficult time doing so due to the lack of an active market.  
Some managed to sell their high risk RMBS securities to investment banks assembling cash 
CDOs.   
 

Some investors, instead of selling their RMBS or CDO securities, purchased “insurance” 
against a loss by buying a credit default swap (CDS) that would pay off if the specified securities 
incurred losses or other negative credit events.  By 2005, investment banks had standardized 
CDS contracts for RMBS and CDO securities, making this a practical alternative.   

 
Much like insurance, the buyer of a CDS contract paid a periodic premium to the CDS 
seller, who guaranteed the referenced security against loss.  CDS contracts referencing a single 
security or corporate bond became known as “single name” CDS contracts.  If the referenced 
security later incurred a loss, the CDS seller had to pay an agreed-upon amount to the CDS buyer 
to cover the loss.  Some investors began to purchase single name CDS contracts, not as a hedge 
to offset losses from RMBS or CDO securities they owned, but as a way to profit from particular 
RMBS or CDO securities they predicted would lose money.  CDS contracts that paid off on 
securities that were not owned by the CDS buyer were known as “naked credit default swaps.”  

                                                      
61 See, e.g., 12 CFR part 3, Appendix A (for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency), 12 CFR part 208, 
Appendix A and 12 CFR part 225, Appendix A (for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors) and 12 CFR part 325, 
Appendix A (for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation).

Some investors purchased large numbers of these CDS contracts in a concerted strategy to profit 
from mortgage backed securities they believed would fail. 

 
Some investment banks took the CDS approach a step further.  In 2006, a consortium of 

  Borrowing from longstanding practice in commodities 

investment banks led by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank launched the ABX Index, which 
created five indices that tracked the aggregate performance of a basket of 20 designated 
subprime RMBS securitizations.63
markets, investors could buy and sell contracts linked to the value of one of the ABX indices.  
Each contract consisted of a credit default swap agreement in which the parties could essentially 
wager on the rise or fall of the index value.  According to a Goldman Sachs employee, the ABX 
Index “introduced a standardized tool that allow[ed] clients to quickly gain exposure to the asset 
class,” in this case subprime RMBS securities.  An investor – or investment bank – taking a short 
position in an ABX contract was, in effect, placing a bet that the basket of subprime RMBS 
securities would lose value. 

 
Synthetic CDOs provided still another vehicle for shorting the mortgage market.  In this 

approach, an investment bank created a synthetic CDO that referenced a variety of RMBS 
securities.  One or more investors could take the “short” position by paying premiums to the 
CDO in exchange for a promise that the CDO would pay a specified amount if the referenced 
assets incurred a negative credit event, such as a default or credit rating downgrade.  If that event 
took place, the CDO would have to pay an agreed-upon amount to the short investors to cover 
the loss, removing income from the CDO and causing losses for the long investors.  Synthetic 
CDOs became a way for investors to short multiple specific RMBS securities that they expected 
would incur losses.   
 
Proprietary Trading.  Financial institutions also built increasingly large proprietary 
 
holdings of mortgage related assets.  Numerous financial firms, including investment banks, 
bought RMBS and CDO securities, and retained these securities in their investment portfolios.  
Others retained these securities in their trading accounts to be used as inventory for short term 
trading activity, market making on behalf of clients, hedging, providing collateral for short term 
loans, or maintaining lower capital requirements.  Deutsche Bank’s RMBS Group in New York, 
for example, built up a $102 billion portfolio of RMBS and CDO securities, while the portfolio 
at an affiliated hedge fund, Winchester Capital, exceeded $8 billion.64
  Other financial firms, 
including Bear Stearns, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan 
Stanley, and UBS also accumulated enormous propriety holdings in mortgage related products.  
When the value of these holdings dropped, some of these financial institutions lost tens of 

                                                      
63 Each of the five indices tracked a different tranche of securities from the designated 20 subprime RMBS 
securitizations.  One index tracked AAA rated securities from the 20 subprime RMBS securities; the second tracked 
AA rated securities from the 20 RMBS securitizations; and the remaining indices tracked baskets of A, BBB, and 
BBB rated RMBS securities.  Every six months, a new set of RMBS securitizations was selected for a new ABX 
index.  See 3/2008 “Understanding the Securitization of Subprime Mortgage Credit,” prepared by Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, Report No. 318, at 26.  Markit Group Ltd. administered the ABX Index which issued indices in 
2006 and 2007, but has not issued any new indices since then.

2006, Goldman Sachs decided to reverse course, using a variety of means to bet against the 
mortgage market.  In some cases, Goldman Sachs took proprietary positions that paid off only 
when some of its clients lost money on the very securities that Goldman Sachs had sold to them 
and then shorted.  Altogether in 2007, Goldman’s mortgage department made $1.1 billion in net 
revenues from shorting the mortgage market.69  Despite those gains, Goldman Sachs was given a 
$10 billion taxpayer bailout under the Troubled Asset Relief Program,70 tens of billions of 
dollars in support through accessing the Federal Reserve’s Primary Dealer Credit Facility,71 and 
billions more in indirect government support72

 to ensure its continued existence. 

E.   Market Oversight 
U.S. financial regulators failed to stop financial firms from engaging in high risk, 

conflict-ridden activities.  Those regulatory failures arose, in part, from the fragmented nature of 
U.S. financial oversight as well as statutory barriers to regulating high risk financial products.

positions in a number of [its] businesses.  These positions are accounted for at fair value, and the declines in the 
values of assets have had a direct and large negative impact on [its] earnings in fiscal 2008.”); see also, Viral V.

37 

Oversight of Lenders.  At the end of 2005, the United States had about 8,800 federally 

insured banks and thrifts,73 plus about 8,700 federally insured credit unions, many of which were 
in the business of issuing home loans.74  On the federal level, these financial institutions were 
overseen by five agencies:  the Federal Reserve which oversaw state-chartered banks that were 
part of the Federal Reserve System as well as foreign banks and others; the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) which oversaw banks with national charters; the Office of 
Thrift Supervision (OTS) which oversaw federally-chartered thrifts; the National Credit Union 
Administration which oversaw federal credit unions; and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) which oversaw financial institutions that have federal deposit insurance 
(hereinafter referred to as “federal bank regulators”).75
  In addition, state banking regulators 
oversaw the state-chartered institutions and at times took action to require federally-chartered 
financial institutions to comply with certain state laws. 

 

The primary responsibility of the federal bank regulators was to ensure the safety and 

 
soundness of the financial institutions they oversaw.  One key mechanism they used to carry out 
that responsibility was to conduct examinations on a periodic basis of the financial institutions 
within their jurisdiction and provide the results in an annual Report of Examination (ROE) given 
to the Board of Directors at each entity.  The largest U.S. financial institutions typically operated 
under a “continuous exam” program, which required federal bank examiners to conduct a series 
of specialized examinations during the year with the results from all of those examinations 
included in the annual ROE.   

Federal examination activities were typically led by an Examiner in Charge and were 

 
organized around a rating system called CAMELS that was used by all federal bank regulators.  
The CAMELS rating system evaluated a financial institution’s:  (C) capital adequacy, (A) asset 
quality, (M) management, (E) earnings, (L) liquidity, and (S) sensitivity to market risk.  
CAMELS ratings are on a scale of 1 to 5, in which 1 signifies a safe and secure bank with no 
cause for supervisory concern, 3 signifies an institution with supervisory concerns in one or more 
areas, and 5 signifies an unsafe and unsound bank with severe supervisory concerns.  In the 
annual ROE, regulators typically provided a financial institution with a rating for each CAMELS 
component, as well as an overall composite rating on its safety and soundness.   

In addition, the FDIC conducted its own examinations of financial institutions with 

federal deposit insurance.  The FDIC reviews relied heavily on the examination findings and 
ROEs developed by the primary regulator of the financial institution, but the FDIC assigned its 
own CAMELS ratings to each institution.  In addition, for institutions with assets of $10 billion 
or more, the FDIC established a Large Insured Depository Institutions (LIDI) Program to assess 
and report on emerging risks that may pose a threat to the federal Deposit Insurance Fund.  
Under this program, the FDIC performed an ongoing analysis of emerging risks within each 

                                                      
73 See FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile, 1 (Fourth Quarter 2005) (showing that, as of 12/31/2005, the United States 
had 8,832 federal and state chartered insured banks and thrifts). 
74 See 1/3/2011 chart, “Insurance Fund Ten-Year Trends,” supplied by the National Credit Union Administration 
(showing that, as of 12/31/2005, the United States had 8,695 federal and state credit unions).

duties to the OCC.  See Chapter IV. 

38 

insured institution and assigned a quarterly risk rating, using a scale of A to E, with A being the 
best rating and E the worst.   

 
If a regulator became concerned about the safety or soundness of a financial institution, it 

had a wide range of informal and formal enforcement actions that could be used to require 
operational changes.  Informal actions included requiring the financial institution to issue a 
safety and soundness plan, memorandum of understanding, Board resolution, or commitment 
letter pledging to take specific corrective actions by a certain date, or issuing a supervisory letter 
to the financial institution listing specific “matters requiring attention.”  These informal 
enforcement actions are generally not made public and are not enforceable in court.  Formal 
enforcement actions included a regulator issuing a public memorandum of understanding, 
consent order, or cease and desist order requiring the financial institution to stop an unsafe 
practice or take an affirmative action to correct identified problems; imposing a civil monetary 
penalty; suspending or removing personnel from the financial institution; or referring misconduct 
for criminal prosecution.   

 
A wide range of large and small banks and thrifts were active in the mortgage market.  

Banks like Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo originated, 
purchased, and securitized billions of dollars in home loans each year.  Thrifts, whose charters 
typically required them to hold 65% of their assets in mortgage related assets, also originated, 
purchased, sold, and securitized billions of dollars in home loans, including such major lenders 
as Countrywide Financial Corporation, IndyMac Bank, and Washington Mutual Bank.  Some of 
these banks and thrifts also had affiliates, such as Long Beach Mortgage Corporation, which 
specialized in issuing subprime mortgages.  Still more lenders operated outside of the regulated 
banking system, including New Century Financial Corporation and Fremont Loan & Investment, 
which used such corporate vehicles as industrial loan companies, real estate investment trusts, or 
publicly traded corporations to carry out their businesses.  In addition, the mortgage market was 
populated with tens of thousands of mortgage brokers that were paid fees for their loans or for 
bringing qualified borrowers to a lender to execute a home loan.76
 

   

Oversight of Securities Firms.  Another group of financial institutions active in the 

mortgage market were securities firms, including investment banks, broker-dealers, and 
investment advisors.  These security firms did not originate home loans, but typically helped 
design, underwrite, market, or trade securities linked to residential mortgages, including the 
RMBS and CDO securities that were at the heart of the financial crisis.  Key firms included Bear 
Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and the asset 
management arms of large banks, including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and JPMorgan Chase.  
Some of these firms also had affiliates which specialized in securitizing subprime mortgages.  

Securities firms were overseen on the federal level by the Securities and Exchange 

Commission (SEC) whose mission is to “protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient 
                                                      
76 1/2009 “Financial Regulation:  A Framework for Crafting and Assessing Proposals to Modernize the Outdated 
U.S. Financial Regulatory System,” prepared by the Government Accountability Office, Report No. GAO-09-216, at

markets, and facilitate capital formation.”77  The SEC oversees the “key participants in the 
securities world, including securities exchanges, securities brokers and dealers, investment 
advisors, and mutual funds,” primarily for the purpose of “promoting the disclosure of important 
market related information, maintaining fair dealing, and protecting against fraud.”78

 

The securities firms central to the financial crisis were subject to a variety of SEC 

regulations in their roles as broker-dealers, investment advisors, market makers, underwriters, 
79  The 
and placement agents.  Most were also subject to oversight by state securities regulators.
securities firms were required to submit a variety of public filings with the SEC about their 
operations and in connection with the issuance of new securities.  The SEC’s Office of 
Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) conducted inspections of broker-dealers, 
among others, to understand industry practices, encourage compliance, evaluate risk 
management, and detect violations of the securities laws.  In addition, under the voluntary 
Consolidated Supervised Entities program, the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets 
monitored the investment activities of the largest broker-dealers, including Bear Stearns, 
Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and JPMorgan 
Chase, evaluating their capital levels, use of leverage, and risk management.80

  

 
Like bank regulators, if the SEC became concerned about a particular securities firm, it 
could choose from a range of informal and formal enforcement actions.  Informal actions could 
include issuing a “deficiency letter” identifying problems and requiring the securities firm to take 
corrective action by a certain date.  Formal enforcement actions, undertaken by the SEC’s 
Division of Enforcement, could include civil proceedings before an administrative law judge; a 
civil complaint filed in federal district court; civil fines; an order to suspend or remove personnel 
from a firm or bar them from the brokerage industry; or a referral for criminal prosecution.  
Common securities violations included selling unregistered securities, misrepresenting 
information about a security, unfair dealing, price manipulation, and insider trading.81
 

 
Statutory and Regulatory Barriers.  Federal and state financial regulators responsible 
for oversight of banks, securities firms, and other financial institutions in the years leading to the 
financial crisis operated under a number of statutory and regulatory constraints. 

 
One key constraint was the sweeping statutory prohibition on the federal regulation of 

  The key statutory section 

any type of swap, including credit default swaps.  This prohibition took effect in 2000, with 
enactment of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFMA).82
explicitly prohibited federal regulators from requiring the registration of swaps as securities; 
issuing or enforcing any regulations or orders related to swaps; or imposing any recordkeeping 
                                                      
77 See SEC website, “About the SEC: What We Do,” 
78 Id. 
79 Some firms active in the U.S. securities and mortgage markets, such as hedge funds, operated without meaningful 
federal oversight by taking advantage of exemptions in the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
80 See 9/2008 “SEC’s Oversight of Bear Stearns and Related Entities: The Consolidated Entity Program,” report 
prepared by Office of the SEC Inspector General, Report No. 446-A.Report No. 446-A, (9/2008). 
81 See SEC website, “About the SEC: What We Do,” www.sec.gov.

requirements for swaps.83  In addition, the law explicitly prohibited regulation of any “‘interest 
rate swap,’ including a rate floor, rate cap, rate collar, cross-currency rate swap, basis swap, 
currency swap, equity index swap, equity swap, debt index swap, debt swap, credit spread, credit 
default swap, credit swap, weather swap, or commodity swap.”84
  These prohibitions meant that 
federal regulators could not even ask U.S. financial institutions to report on their swaps trades or 
holdings, much less regulate swap dealers or examine how swaps were affecting the mortgage 
market or other U.S. financial markets. 

 
As a result, the multi-trillion-dollar U.S. swaps markets operated with virtually no 

disclosure requirements, no restrictions, and no oversight by any federal agency, including the 
market for credit default swaps which played a prominent role in the financial crisis.  On 
September 23, 2008, in a hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs, then SEC Chairman Christopher Cox testified that, as a result of the statutory 
prohibition, the credit default swap market “is completely lacking in transparency,”  “is regulated 
by no one,” and “is ripe for fraud and manipulation.”85  In a September 26, 2008 press release, he 
discussed regulatory gaps impeding his agency and again raised the issue of swaps:  
“Unfortunately, as I reported to Congress this week, a massive hole remains:  the approximately 
$60 trillion credit default swap market, which is regulated by no agency of government.  Neither 
the SEC nor any regulator has authority even to require minimum disclosure.”86  In 2010, the 
Dodd-Frank Act removed the CFMA prohibition on regulating swaps.87

 

A second significant obstacle for financial regulators was the patchwork of federal and 

    

state laws and regulations applicable to high risk mortgages and mortgage brokers.  Federal bank 
regulators took until October 2006, to provide guidance to federal banks on acceptable lending 
88  Even then, the regulators issued voluntary guidance 
practices related to high risk home loans.
whose standards were not enforceable in court and failed to address such key issues as the 
acceptability of stated income loans.89  In addition, while Congress had authorized the Federal 
Reserve, in 1994, to issue regulations to prohibit deceptive or abusive mortgage practices – 
regulations that could have applied across the board to all types of lenders and mortgage brokers 
– the Federal Reserve failed to issue any until July 2008, after the financial crisis had already 
hit.90

90 Congress authorized the Federal Reserve to issue the regulations in Section 151 of the Home Ownership and 
Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA), P.L. 103-325.  The Federal Reserve did not issue any regulations under 
HOEPA, however, until July 2008, when it amended Regulation Z.  The new rules primarily strengthened consumer 
protections for “higher priced loans,” which included many types of subprime loans.  See “New Regulation Z Rules

A third problem, exclusive to state regulators, was a 2005 regulation issued by the OCC 
to prohibit states from enforcing state consumer protection laws against national banks.91  After 
the New York State Attorney General issued subpoenas to several national banks to enforce New 
York’s fair lending laws, a legal battle ensued.  In 2009, the Supreme Court invalidated the OCC 
regulation, and held that states were allowed to enforce state consumer protection laws against 
national banks.92
effectively unable to enforce state laws prohibiting abusive mortgage practices against federally-
chartered banks and thrifts. 
 

  During the intervening four years, however, state regulators had been 

Systemic Risk.  While bank and securities regulators focused on the safety and 

soundness of individual financial institutions, no regulator was charged with identifying, 
preventing, or managing risks that threatened the safety and soundness of the overall U.S. 
financial system.  In the area of high risk mortgage lending, for example, bank regulators 
allowed banks to issue high risk mortgages as long as it was profitable and the banks quickly 
sold the high risk loans to get them off their books.  Securities regulators allowed investment 
banks to underwrite, buy, and sell mortgage backed securities relying on high risk mortgages, as 
long as the securities received high ratings from the credit rating agencies and so were deemed 
“safe” investments.  No regulatory agency focused on what would happen when poor quality 
mortgages were allowed to saturate U.S. financial markets and contaminate RMBS and CDO 
securities with high risk loans.  In addition, none of the regulators focused on the impact 
derivatives like credit default swaps might have in exacerbating risk exposures, since they were 
barred by federal law from regulating or even gathering data about these financial instruments.  
 

F.  Government Sponsored Enterprises 
 
Between 1990 and 2004, homeownership rates in the United States increased rapidly 

from 64% to 69%, the highest level in 50 years.93
  While many highly regarded economists and 
officials argued at the time that this housing boom was the result of healthy economic activity, in 
retrospect, some federal housing policies encouraged people to purchase homes they were 
ultimately unable to afford, which helped to inflate the housing bubble.   

 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Two government sponsored entities (GSE), the Federal 
National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation 
(Freddie Mac), were chartered by Congress to encourage homeownership primarily by providing 
a secondary market for home mortgages.  They created that secondary market by purchasing 
loans from lenders, securitizing them, providing a guarantee that they would make up the cost of 
                                                                                                                                                                           
other requirements, the rules prohibited lenders “from making loans based on collateral without regard to [the 
borrower’s] repayment ability,” required lenders to “verify income and obligations,” and imposed “more stringent 
restrictions on prepayment penalties.”  The rules also required lenders to “establish escrow accounts for taxes and 
mortgage related insurance for first-lien loans.”  In addition, the rules “prohibit[ed] coercion of appraisers, define[d] 
inappropriate practices for loan servicers, and require[d] early truth in lending disclosures for most mortgages.”).

any securitized mortgage that defaulted, and selling the resulting mortgage backed securities to 
investors.  Many believed that the securities had the implicit backing of the federal government 
and viewed them as very safe investments, leading investors around the world to purchase them.  
The existence of this secondary market encouraged lenders to originate more loans, since they 
could easily sell them to the GSEs and use the profits to increase their lending. 

 
Over time, however, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began to purchase larger quantities of 

higher risk loans, providing a secondary market for those loans and encouraging their 
proliferation.  Between 2005 and 2007, Fannie Mae alone purchased billions of dollars in high 
risk home loans, including Option ARM, Alt A, and loans with subprime characteristics.  For 
example, data from Fannie Mae shows that, in mid 2008, 62% of the Option ARM loans on its 
books had been purchased between 2005 and 2007.94  Likewise, 84% of its interest-only loans 
were purchased in that time frame, as were 57% of those with FICO scores less than 620; 62% of 
its loans with loan-to-value ratios greater than 90; and 73% of its Alt A loans.95  While these 
loans constituted only a small percentage of Fannie Mae’s purchases at the time, they came to 
account for some its most significant losses.  By the middle of 2009, Fannie Mae reported an 
unpaid principal balance of $878 billion for its loans with subprime characteristics, nearly a third 
of its total portfolio of $2.7 trillion.96

 

 
According to economist Arnold Kling, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased these 

loans after “lowering their own credit standards in order to maintain a presence in the market and 
to meet their affordable housing goals.”97

 

Throughout their history, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were able to bundle the 

mortgages they purchased into securities that were popular with investors, because many 
believed the securities carried the implicit support of the federal government.  The Congressional 
Budget Office found the following: 

 
“Because of their [Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac] size and interconnectedness with other 
financial institutions, they posed substantial systemic risk—the risk that their failure 
could impose very high costs on the financial system and the economy.  The GSEs’ 
market power also allowed them to use their profits partly to benefit their other stake-
holders rather than exclusively to benefit mortgage borrowers.  The implicit guarantee 
created an incentive for the GSEs to take excessive risks: Stakeholders would benefit 
when gambles paid off, but taxpayers would absorb the losses when they did not. … 
 
One way that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac increased risk was by expanding the volume 
of mortgages and MBSs held in their portfolios, which exposed them to the risk of losses

from changes in interest or prepayment rates.  Over the past decade, the two GSEs also 
increased their exposure to default losses by investing in lower-quality mortgages, such 
as subprime and Alt-A loans.”98
 
The risks embedded in their mortgage portfolios finally overwhelmed the GSEs in 

 

 

September 2008, and both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken into conservatorship by the 
federal government.  Since that time, the Treasury Department has spent nearly $150 billion to 
support the two GSEs, a total which projections show could rise to as high as $363 billion.99

 
Ginnie Mae.  Additional housing policies that allowed borrowers with less than adequate 
credit to obtain traditional mortgages included programs at the Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Both agencies provided loan guarantees to 
lenders that originated loans for borrowers that qualified under the agencies’ rules.  Many of the 
loans guaranteed by the FHA and VA, some of which required down payments as low as 3%, 
were bundled and sold as mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the Government National 
Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), a government corporation.  Ginnie Mae guaranteed 
investors the timely payment of principal and interest on mortgage backed securities backed by 
federally insured or guaranteed loans.   

 
In the years leading up to the financial crisis, FHA guaranteed millions of home loans 
  According to FHA data, as of 2011, nearly 20% of all 

worth hundreds of billions of dollars.100
FHA loans originated in 2008 were seriously delinquent, meaning borrowers had missed three or 
more payments, while loans originated in 2007 had a serious delinquency rate of over 22%.  The 
2007 and 2008 loans, which currently make up about 15% of FHA’s active loan portfolio, 
remain the worst performing in that portfolio.  In 2009 and 2010, FHA tightened its underwriting 
guidelines, and the loans it guaranteed performed substantially better.  By early 2011, the serious 
delinquency rate for all FHA borrowers was about 8.8%, down from over 9.4% the prior year. 

 
G. Administrative and Legislative Actions 
In response to the financial crisis, Congress and the Executive Branch have taken a 

number of actions.  Three that have brought significant changes are the Troubled Asset Relief 
Program, Federal Reserve assistance programs, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer 
Protection Act. 

Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).  On October 3, 2008, Congress passed and 
President Bush signed into law the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, P.L. 110-
343.  This law, which passed both Houses with bipartisan majorities, established the Troubled

Asset Relief Program (TARP) and authorized the expenditure of up to $700 billion to stop 
financial institutions from collapsing and further damaging the U.S. economy.  Administered by 
the Department of the Treasury, with support from the Federal Reserve, TARP funds have been 
used to inject capital into or purchase or insure assets at hundreds of large and small banks.   

The largest recipients of TARP funds were AIG, Ally Financial (formerly GMAC 

Financial Services), Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan 
Stanley, PNC Financial Services, U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo, as well as Chrysler, and 
General Motors.  Most have repaid all or a substantial portion of the TARP funds they received.   

Although initially expected to cost U.S. taxpayers more than $350 billion, the 

Congressional Budget Office estimated in November 2010, that the final cost of the TARP 
program will be approximately $25 billion.101

   

Federal Reserve Emergency Support Programs.  In addition, as the financial crisis 
began to unfold, the Federal Reserve aggressively expanded its balance sheet from about $900 
billion at the beginning of 2008, to more than $2.4 trillion in December 2010, to provide support 
to the U.S. financial system and economy.  Using more than a dozen programs, through more 
than 21,000 individual transactions, the Federal Reserve provided trillions of dollars in assistance 
to U.S. and foreign financial institutions in an effort to promote liquidity and prevent a financial

collapse.
Mortgage Backed Securities Purchase Program which purchased more than $1.25 trillion in 
mortgage backed securities backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae.103
instances, it modified and significantly expanded existing programs, such as by lowering the 
quality of collateral it accepted and increasing lending by the discount window. 

  In other 

Dodd-Frank Act.  On July 21, 2010, Congress passed and President Obama signed into 
law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, P.L. 111-203.  This law, 
which passed both Houses with bipartisan majorities, expanded the authority of regulatory 
agencies to try to prevent future financial crises.  Among other provisions, the law: 

– established a Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of federal financial 

regulators and others, to identify and respond to emerging financial risks; 

 
– established a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to strengthen protection of 

American consumers from abusive financial products and practices; 

 
– restricted proprietary trading and investments in hedge funds by banks and other large 

financial institutions;

– prohibited sponsors of asset backed securities from engaging in transactions that would 

involve or result in a material conflict of interest with investors in those securities; 

 
– established procedures to require nonbank firms whose failure would threaten U.S. 

financial stability to divest some holdings or undergo an orderly liquidation; 

 
– strengthened regulation of credit rating agencies; 
 
– strengthened mortgage regulation, including by clamping down on high cost mortgages, 

requiring securitizers to retain limited liability for securities reliant on high risk 
mortgages, banning stated income loans, and restricting negative amortization loans;  

 
– required better federal regulation of mortgage brokers; 
 
– directed regulators to require greater capital and liquidity reserves; 
 
– required regulation of derivatives and derivative dealers; 
 
– required registration of certain hedge funds and private equity funds; 
 
– authorized regulators to impose standards of conduct that are the same as those 
applicable to investment advisers on broker-dealers who provide personalized 
investment advice to retail customers; and 

 
– abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
 
H.  Financial Crisis Timeline 

This Report reviews events from the period 2004 to 2008, in an effort to identify and 

 
 
 
explain four significant causes of the financial crisis.  A variety of events could be identified as 
the start of the crisis.  Candidates include the record number of home loan defaults that began in 
December 2006; the FDIC’s March 2007 cease and desist order against Fremont Investment & 
Loan which exposed the existence of unsafe and unsound subprime lending practices; or the 
collapse of the Bear Stearns hedge funds in June 2007.  Still another candidate is the two-week 
period in September 2008, when half a dozen major U.S. financial institutions failed, were 
forcibly sold, or were bailed out by U.S. taxpayers seeking to prevent a collapse of the U.S. 
economy. 

This Report concludes, however, that the most immediate trigger to the financial crisis 
was the July 2007 decision by Moody’s and S&P to downgrade hundreds of RMBS and CDO 
securities.  The firms took this action because, in the words of one S&P senior analyst, the 
investment grade ratings could not “hold.”  By acknowledging that RMBS and CDO securities 
containing high risk, poor quality mortgages were not safe investments and were going to incur 
losses, the credit rating agencies admitted the emperor had no clothes.  Investors stopped buying, 
the value of the RMBS and CDO securities fell, and financial institutions around the world were

III.  HIGH RISK LENDING:    
 

CASE STUDY OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK 
 
Washington Mutual Bank, known also as WaMu, rose out the ashes of the great Seattle 

fire to make its first home loan in 1890.  By 2004, WaMu had become one of the nation’s largest 
financial institutions and a leading mortgage lender.  Its demise just four years later provides a 
case history that traces not only the rise of high risk lending in the mortgage field, but also how 
those high risk mortgages led to the failure of a leading bank and contributed to the financial 
crisis of 2008. 

 
For many years, WaMu was a mid-sized thrift, specializing in home mortgages.  In the 

48 

1990s, WaMu initiated a period of growth and acquisition, expanding until it became the nation’s 
largest thrift and sixth largest bank, with $300 billion in assets, $188 billion in deposits, 2,300 
branches in 15 states, and over 43,000 employees.  In 2003, its longtime CEO, Kerry Killinger, 
said he wanted to do for the lending industry what Wal-Mart and others did for their industries, 
by catering to middle and lower income Americans and helping the less well off buy homes.105
  
Soon after, WaMu embarked on a strategy of high risk lending.  By 2006, its high risk loans 
began incurring record rates of delinquency and default, and its securitizations saw ratings 
downgrades and losses.  In 2007, the bank itself began incurring losses.  Its shareholders lost 
confidence, and depositors began withdrawing funds, eventually causing a liquidity crisis.  On 
September 25, 2008, 119 years to the day of its founding, WaMu was seized by its regulator, the 
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and sold to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion.  Had the sale 
not gone through, WaMu’s failure might have exhausted the $45 billion Deposit Insurance Fund.  
Washington Mutual is the largest bank failure in U.S. history. 

 
This case study examines how one bank’s strategy for growth and profit led to the 

origination and securitization of hundreds of billions of dollars in poor quality mortgages that 
undermined the U.S. financial system.  WaMu had held itself out as a prudent lender, but in 
reality, the bank turned increasingly to higher risk loans.  Its fixed rate mortgage originations fell 
from 64% of its loan originations in 2003, to 25% in 2006, while subprime, Option ARM, and 
home equity originations jumped from 19% of the originations to 55%.  Using primarily loans 
from its subprime lender, Long Beach Mortgage Corporation, WaMu’s subprime securitizations 
grew sixfold, increasing from about $4.5 billion in 2003, to $29 billion in securitizations in 2006.  
From 2000 to 2007, WaMu and Long Beach together securitized at least $77 billion in subprime 
loans.  WaMu also increased its origination of Option ARMs, its flagship product, which from 
2003 to 2007, represented as much as half of all of WaMu’s loan originations.  In 2006 alone, 
Washington Mutual originated more than $42.6 billion in Option ARM loans and sold or 
securitized at least $115 billion, including sales to the Federal National Mortgage Association 
(Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).  In addition, WaMu 
dramatically increased its origination and securitization of home equity loan products.  By 2007, 
                                                 
105 “Saying Yes, WaMu Built Empire on Shaky Loans,” New York Times (12/27/2008) 
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/business/28wamu.html?_r=1 (quoting Mr. Killinger: “We hope to do to this 
industry what Wal-Mart did to theirs, Starbucks did to theirs, Costco did to theirs and Lowe’s-Home Depot did to 
their industry.  And I think if we’ve done our job, five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank.”). 

 
home equity loans made up $63.5 billion or 27% of its home loan portfolio, a 130% increase 
from 2003.   

 
At the same time that WaMu was implementing its High Risk Lending Strategy, WaMu 

and Long Beach engaged in a host of shoddy lending practices that contributed to a mortgage 
time bomb.  Those practices included qualifying high risk borrowers for larger loans than they 
could afford; steering borrowers to higher risk loans; accepting loan applications without 
verifying the borrower’s income; using loans with teaser rates that could lead to payment shock 
when higher interest rates took effect later on; promoting negatively amortizing loans in which 
many borrowers increased rather than paid down their debt; and authorizing loans with multiple 
layers of risk.  In addition, WaMu and Long Beach failed to enforce compliance with their 
lending standards; allowed excessive loan error and exception rates; exercised weak oversight 
over the third party mortgage brokers who supplied half or more of their loans; and tolerated the 
issuance of loans with fraudulent or erroneous borrower information.  They also designed 
compensation incentives that rewarded loan personnel for issuing a large volume of higher risk 
loans, valuing speed and volume over loan quality. 

 
WaMu’s combination of high risk loans, shoddy lending practices, and weak oversight 

produced hundreds of billions of dollars of poor quality loans that incurred early payment 
defaults, high rates of delinquency, and fraud.  Long Beach mortgages experienced some of the 
highest rates of foreclosure in the industry and their securitizations were among the worst 
performing.  Senior WaMu executives described Long Beach as “terrible” and “a mess,” with 
default rates that were “ugly.”  WaMu’s high risk lending operation was also problem-plagued.   
WaMu management knew of evidence of deficient lending practices, as seen in internal emails, 
audit reports, and reviews.  Internal reviews of WaMu’s loan centers, for example, described 
“extensive fraud” from employees “willfully” circumventing bank policy.  An internal review 
found controls to stop fraudulent loans from being sold to investors were “ineffective.”  On at 
least one occasion, senior managers knowingly sold delinquency-prone loans to investors.  Aside 
from Long Beach, WaMu’s President Steve Rotella described WaMu’s prime home loan 
business as the “worst managed business” he had seen in his career. 

49 

 
Documents obtained by the Subcommittee reveal that WaMu launched its High Risk 

Lending Strategy primarily because higher risk loans and mortgage backed securities could be 
sold for higher prices on Wall Street.  They garnered higher prices, because higher risk meant 
they paid a higher coupon rate than other comparably rated securities, and investors paid a higher 
price to buy them.  Selling or securitizing the loans also removed them from WaMu’s books and 
appeared to insulate the bank from risk.   

 
From 2004 to 2008, WaMu originated a huge number of poor quality mortgages, most of 

which were then resold to investment banks and other investors hungry for mortgage backed 
securities.  For a period of time, demand for these securities was so great that WaMu formed its 
own securitization arm on Wall Street.  Over a period of five years, WaMu and Long Beach 
churned out a steady stream of high risk, poor quality loans and mortgage backed securities that 
later defaulted at record rates.  Once a prudent regional mortgage lender, Washington Mutual 

50 

 
tried – and ultimately failed – to use the profits from poor quality loans as a stepping stone to 
becoming a major Wall Street player. 

 
Washington Mutual was far from the only lender that sold poor quality mortgages and 

mortgage backed securities that undermined U.S. financial markets.  The Subcommittee 
investigation indicates that Washington Mutual was emblematic of a host of financial institutions 
that knowingly originated, sold, and securitized billions of dollars in high risk, poor quality home 
loans.  These lenders were not the victims of the financial crisis; the high risk loans they issued 
became the fuel that ignited the financial crisis. 
 

A.  Subcommittee Investigation and Findings of Fact 

 

As part of its investigation into high risk lending and the Washington Mutual case study, 
the Subcommittee collected millions of pages of documents from Washington Mutual, JPMorgan 
Chase, OTS, the FDIC, eAppraiseIT, Lenders Service Inc., Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, various 
investment banks, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and others.  The documents included email, 
correspondence, internal memoranda, reports, legal pleadings, financial analysis, prospectuses, 
and more.  The Subcommittee also conducted more than 30 interviews with former WaMu 
employees and regulatory officials.  The Subcommittee also spoke with personnel from the 
Offices of the Inspector General at the Department of Treasury and the FDIC, who were engaged 
in a joint review of WaMu’s regulatory oversight and the events leading to its demise.  In 
addition, the Subcommittee spoke with nearly a dozen experts on a variety of banking, 
accounting, regulatory, and legal issues.  On April 13, 2010, the Subcommittee held a hearing 
which took testimony from former WaMu officials and released 86 exhibits.106
 

  

In connection with the hearing, the Subcommittee released a joint memorandum from 

Chairman Carl Levin and Ranking Member Tom Coburn summarizing the investigation to date 
into Washington Mutual and the role of high risk home loans in the financial crisis.  The 
memorandum contained the following findings of fact, which this Report reaffirms. 

1.  High Risk Lending Strategy.  Washington Mutual (WaMu) executives embarked 
upon a High Risk Lending Strategy and increased sales of high risk home loans to 
Wall Street, because they projected that high risk home loans, which generally 
charged higher rates of interest, would be more profitable for the bank than low risk 
home loans. 
 

2.  Shoddy Lending Practices.  WaMu and its affiliate, Long Beach Mortgage 
Company (Long Beach), used shoddy lending practices riddled with credit, 
compliance, and operational deficiencies to make tens of thousands of high risk home 
loans that too often contained excessive risk, fraudulent information, or errors.

Subcommittee on Investigations, S.Hrg. 111-67 (April 13, 2010) (hereinafter “April 13, 2010 Subcommittee 
Hearing”). 

51 

3.  Steering Borrowers to High Risk Loans.  WaMu and Long Beach too often steered 
borrowers into home loans they could not afford, allowing and encouraging them to 
make low initial payments that would be followed by much higher payments, and 
presumed that rising home prices would enable those borrowers to refinance their 
loans or sell their homes before the payments shot up. 

 
4.  Polluting the Financial System.  WaMu and Long Beach securitized over $77 

billion in subprime home loans and billions more in other high risk home loans, used 
Wall Street firms to sell the securities to investors worldwide, and polluted the 
financial system with mortgage backed securities which later incurred high rates of 
delinquency and loss. 

 
5.  Securitizing Delinquency-Prone and Fraudulent Loans.  At times, WaMu selected 

and securitized loans that it had identified as likely to go delinquent, without 
disclosing its analysis to investors who bought the securities, and also securitized 
loans tainted by fraudulent information, without notifying purchasers of the fraud that 
was discovered. 

 
6.  Destructive Compensation.  WaMu’s compensation system rewarded loan officers 

and loan processors for originating large volumes of high risk loans, paid extra to 
loan officers who overcharged borrowers or added stiff prepayment penalties, and 
gave executives millions of dollars even when their High Risk Lending Strategy 
placed the bank in financial jeopardy. 

 

 

B.  Background  

 

Washington Mutual Bank was a federally chartered thrift whose primary federal regulator 

was the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS).  As an insured depository institution, it was also 
overseen by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Washington Mutual was a full 
service consumer and business bank.  This Report focuses only on WaMu’s home lending and 
securitization business.  As part of that business, WaMu originated home loans, acquired home 
loans for investment and securitization, sold pools of loans, and also securitized pools of home 
loans that it had originated or acquired.  It was also a leading servicer of residential mortgages. 

 
(1)  Major Business Lines and Key Personnel 
 
From 2004 to 2008, WaMu had four major business lines.107

  The Home Loans Group 
handled WaMu’s home mortgage originations, securitizations, and servicing operations.  The 
Commercial Group handled apartment buildings and other commercial properties.  The Retail 
Banking Group provided retail banking services to consumers and businesses across the country.  
The Card Services Group handled a credit card business purchased from Providian Financial 
Corporation.

52 

For most of the five-year period reviewed by the Subcommittee, WaMu was led by its 

longtime Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Kerry Killinger who joined 
the bank in 1982, became bank president in 1988, and was appointed CEO in 1990.  Mr. 
Killinger was the moving force behind WaMu’s acquisitions and growth strategy during the 
1990s, and made the fateful decision to embark upon its High Risk Lending Strategy in 2005.  
Mr. Killinger stepped down as Chairman of the Board in June 2008, after shareholders opposed 
having the same person occupy the bank’s two top positions.  He was dismissed from the bank 
on September 8, 2008, the same day WaMu was required by its regulator, OTS, to sign a public 
Memorandum of Understanding to address its lending and securitization deficiencies.  Two 
weeks later the bank failed. 
 

Other key members of the bank’s senior management included President Steve Rotella 

who joined the bank in January 2005; Chief Financial Officer Tom Casey; President of the Home 
Loans Division David Schneider who joined the bank in July 2005; and General Counsel Faye 
Chapman.  David Beck served as Executive Vice President in charge of the bank’s Capital 
Markets Division, oversaw its securitization efforts, and reported to the head of Home Loans.  
Anthony Meola headed up the Home Loans Sales effort.  Jim Vanasek was WaMu’s Chief Credit 
Officer from 1999 until 2004, and was then appointed its Chief Risk Officer, a new position, 
from 2004-2005.  After Mr. Vanasek’s retirement, Ronald Cathcart took his place as Chief Risk 
Officer, and headed the bank’s newly organized Enterprise Risk Management Division, serving 
in that post from 2005 to 2007. 

 

 

 
(2)  Loan Origination Channels 
WaMu was one of the largest mortgage originators in the United States.108

  It originated 

and acquired residential mortgages through several methods, which it referred to as loan 
origination channels.  WaMu referred to them as its retail, wholesale, subprime, correspondent, 
and conduit channels.  

 
Retail Channel.  In WaMu’s parlance, “retail channel” loans were loans originated by 
WaMu employees, typically loan officers or sales associates operating out of WaMu branded 
loan centers.  The prospective borrower typically communicated directly with the WaMu loan 
officer, who was often called a “loan consultant.”  WaMu considered all retail channel loans to 
be “prime” loans, regardless of the characteristics of the loan or the creditworthiness of the 
borrower, and sometimes referred to the retail channel as the “prime” channel.  The retail 
channel originated significant numbers of Option ARM loans, which WaMu treated as prime 
loans, despite their inherent risks.  According to the Inspectors General of the U.S. Treasury 
Department and the FDIC, who prepared a report on WaMu’s failure (hereinafter “IG Report”), 
“Option ARMs represented as much as half of all loan originations from 2003 to 2007 and 
approximately $59 billion, or 47 percent, of the home loans on WaMu’s balance sheet at the end 
                                                 
108 See, e.g., “Mortgage Lender Rankings by Residential Originations,” charts prepared by MortgageDaily.com 
(indicating WaMu was one of the top three issuers of U.S. residential mortgages from 2003 to 2005); “Washington 
Mutual to Acquire PNC’s Residential Mortgage Business,” Business Wire (10/2/2000), 
http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_Oct_2/ai_65635032. 

 
of 2007.”109
loans and home equity lines of credit.   

  The retail channel was also used to originate substantial numbers of home equity 

53 

 
Wholesale Channel.  According to WaMu, its “wholesale channel” loans were loans that 

the bank acquired from third party mortgage brokers.  These brokers, who were not WaMu 
employees, located borrowers interested in purchasing a home or refinancing an existing 
mortgage, and explained available loans that could be underwritten by WaMu.  The borrower’s 
primary, and sometimes sole, contact was with the mortgage broker.  The mortgage broker 
would then provide the borrower’s information to a WaMu loan officer who would determine 
whether the bank would finance the loan.  If the bank decided to finance the loan, the broker 
would receive a commission for its efforts.  Third party mortgage brokers typically received little 
guidance or training from WaMu, aside from receiving daily “rate sheets” explaining the terms 
of the loans that WaMu was willing to accept and the available commissions.  WaMu treated 
wholesale loans issued under the WaMu brand as prime loans.     

 
Subprime Channel.  WaMu also originated wholesale loans through its subprime 

affiliate and later subsidiary, Long Beach Mortgage Company (Long Beach).  Long Beach was a 
purely wholesale lender, and employed no loan officers that worked directly with borrowers.  
Instead, its account executives developed relationships with third party mortgage brokers who 
brought prospective loans to the company, and if Long Beach accepted those loans, received a 
commission for their efforts.  WaMu typically referred to Long Beach as its “subprime channel.”  
Later, in 2007, when the bank decided to eliminate Long Beach as a separate entity, it rebranded 
Long Beach as its “Wholesale Specialty Lending” channel. 

 
At times, WaMu also acquired subprime loans through “correspondent” or “conduit” 

channels, which it used to purchase closed loans – loans that had already been financed – from 
other lenders for investment or securitization.  For example, WaMu at times operated a 
correspondent channel that it referred to as “Specialty Mortgage Finance” and used to purchase 
subprime loans from other lenders, especially Ameriquest, for inclusion in its investment 
portfolio.  In addition, in 2005, its New York securitization arm, Washington Mutual Capital 
Corporation, established a “subprime conduit” to purchase closed subprime loans in bulk from 
other lenders for use in securitizations.  At the end of 2006, WaMu reported that its investment 
portfolio included $4 billion in subprime loans from Long Beach and about $16 billion in 
subprime loans from other parties.110
   

Other Channels.  At times, WaMu also originated or acquired loans in other ways.  Its 
“Consumer Direct” channel, for example, originated loans over the phone or internet; borrowers 
did not need to meet in person with a WaMu loan officer.  In addition, in 2004, Washington 
Mutual Capital Corporation (WCC) set up a conduit to purchase closed Alt A loans in bulk from

Offices of Inspector General at the Department of the Treasury and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Hearing

110 See 3/1/2007 Washington Mutual Inc. 10-K filing with the SEC, at 56. 

54 

 
other lenders and use them in securitizations.  WCC shut down both the Alt A and subprime 
conduits in April 2008, after it became too difficult to find buyers for new securitizations.111
 
 

The Treasury and the FDIC IG report examining the failure of WaMu found that, from 

2003 to 2007, the bulk of its residential loans – from 48% to 70% – came from third party 
lenders and brokers.112  That report also determined that, in 2007, WaMu had 14 full-time 
employees overseeing 34,000 third party brokers doing business with the bank nationwide, and 
criticized the Bank’s oversight and staffing effort.113

   

(3)  Long Beach 

 

WaMu had traditionally originated mortgages to well qualified prime borrowers.  But in 

1999, WaMu bought Long Beach Mortgage Company,114 which was exclusively a subprime 
lender to borrowers whose credit histories did not support their getting a traditional mortgage.115
Long Beach was located in Anaheim, California, had a network of loan centers across the 
country, and at its height had as many as 1,000 employees. 

 
Long Beach made loans for the express purpose of securitizing them and profiting from 
the gain on sale; it did not hold loans for its own investment.  It had no loan officers of its own, 
but relied entirely on third party mortgage brokers bringing proposed subprime loans to its 
doors.  In 2000, the year after it was purchased by WaMu, Long Beach made and securitized 
approximately $2.5 billion in home loans.   By 2006, its loan operations had increased more than 
tenfold, and Long Beach securitized nearly $30 billion in subprime home loans and sold the 
securities to investors.116

 

  

 
Long Beach’s most common subprime loans were short term, hybrid adjustable rate 

mortgages, known as “2/28,” “3/27,” or “5/25” loans.  These 30-year mortgages typically had a 
low fixed “teaser” rate, which then reset to a higher floating rate after two years for the 2/28, 
three years for the 3/27, or five years for the 5/25.117
  Long Beach typically qualified borrowers 
according to whether they could afford to pay the initial, low interest rate rather than the later,

brokers.”).

55 

  For “interest-only” loans, monthly loan payments were calculated to 

 
higher interest rate.118
cover only the interest due on the loan and not any principal.  After the fixed interest rate period 
expired, the monthly payment was typically recalculated to pay off the entire remaining loan 
within the remaining loan period at the higher floating rate.  Unless borrowers could refinance, 
the suddenly increased monthly payments caused some borrowers to experience “payment 
shock” and default on their loans. 
 
 
From 1999 to 2006, Long Beach operated as a subsidiary of Washington Mutual Inc., the 
parent of Washington Mutual Bank.  Long Beach’s loans repeatedly experienced early payment 
defaults, high delinquency rates, and losses, and its securitizations were among the worst 
performing in the market.119
  In 2006, in a bid to strengthen Long Beach’s performance, WaMu 
received permission from its regulator, OTS, to purchase the company from its parent and make 
it a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank.  WaMu installed new management, required the head 
of Long Beach to report to its Home Loans Division President, and promised OTS that it would 
improve Long Beach.  When Long Beach’s loans continued to perform poorly, in June 2007, 
WaMu shut down Long Beach as a separate entity, and took over its subprime lending 
operations, rebranding Long Beach as its “Wholesale Specialty Lending” channel.  WaMu 
continued to issue and securitize subprime loans.  After the subprime market essentially shut 
down a few months later in September 2007, WaMu ended all of its subprime lending.   
 

From 2000 to 2007, Long Beach and WaMu together securitized tens of billions of 

dollars in subprime loans, creating mortgage backed securities that frequently received AAA or 
other investment grade credit ratings.120  Although AAA securities are supposed to be very safe 
investments with low default rates of one to two percent, of the 75 Long Beach mortgage backed 
security tranches rated AAA by Standard and Poor’s in 2006, all 75 have been downgraded to 
junk status, defaulted, or been withdrawn.121  In most of the 2006 Long Beach securitizations, 
the underlying loans have delinquency rates of 50% or more.122

  

 
(4)  Securitization 

 

Washington Mutual depended on the securitization process to generate profit, manage 

risk, and obtain capital to originate new loans.  Washington Mutual and Long Beach sold or 
securitized most of the subprime home loans they acquired.  Initially, Washington Mutual kept 
most of its Option ARMs in its proprietary investment portfolio, but eventually began selling or 
securitizing those loans as well.  From 2000 to 2007, Washington Mutual and Long Beach

54.32%).

securitized at least $77 billion in subprime home loans.  Washington Mutual sold or securitized 
at least $115 billion of Option ARM loans, as well as billions more of other types of high risk 
loans, including hybrid adjustable rate mortgages, Alt A, and home equity loans. 

 
When Washington Mutual began securitizing its loans, it was dependent upon investment 

banks to help underwrite and sell its securitizations.  In order to have greater control of the 
securitization process and to keep securitization underwriting fees in house, rather than paying 
them to investment banks, WaMu acquired a company able to handle securitizations and 
renamed it Washington Mutual Capital Corporation (WCC), which became a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the bank.123  WCC was a registered broker-dealer and began to act as an 
underwriter of WaMu and Long Beach securitizations.124
subsidiaries, Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. and Washington Mutual Asset 
Acceptance Corp., that provided warehousing for WaMu loans before they were securitized.  
WCC helped to assemble RMBS pools and sell the resulting RMBS securities to investors.  At 
first it worked with other investment banks; later it became the sole underwriter of some WaMu 
securitizations.  

   WCC worked with two other bank 

 
WCC was initially based in Seattle with 30 to 40 employees.125  In 2004, it moved its 

 
headquarters to Manhattan.126  At the height of WCC operations, right before the collapse of the 
securitization market, WCC had over 200 employees and offices in Seattle, New York, Los 
Angeles, and Chicago, with the majority of its personnel in New York.127

(5)  Overview of WaMu’s Rise and Fall 

 

Washington Mutual Bank (WaMu) was a wholly owned subsidiary of its parent holding 
company, Washington Mutual Inc.128
  From 1996 to 2002, WaMu acquired over a dozen other 
financial institutions, including American Savings Bank, Great Western Bank, Fleet Mortgage 
Corporation, Dime Bancorp, PNC Mortgage, and Long Beach, expanding to become the nation’s 
largest thrift and sixth largest bank.  WaMu also became one of the largest issuers of home loans 
in the country.  Washington Mutual kept a portion of those loans for its own investment 
portfolio, and sold the rest either to Wall Street investors, usually after securitizing them, or to 
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.  From 2000 to 2008, Washington Mutual sold over $500 billion in 
loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, representing more than a quarter of its loan production 
during those years.

In 2006, WaMu took several major actions that reduced the size of its Home Loans 
Group.  It sold $140 billion in mortgage servicing rights to Wells Fargo; sold a $22 billion 
portfolio of home loans and other securities; and reduced its workforce significantly.129

 

 
In July 2007, after the Bear Stearns hedge funds collapsed and the credit rating agencies 

downgraded the ratings of hundreds of mortgaged backed securities, including over 40 Long 
Beach securities, the secondary market for subprime loans dried up.  In September 2007, due to 
the difficulty of finding investors willing to purchase subprime loans or mortgage backed 
securities, Washington Mutual discontinued its subprime lending.  It also became increasingly 
difficult for Washington Mutual to sell other types of high risk loans and related mortgage 
backed securities, including its Option ARMs and home equity products.  Instead, WaMu 
retained these loans in its portfolios.  By the end of the year, as the value of its loans and 
mortgage backed securities continued to drop, Washington Mutual began to incur significant 
losses, reporting a $1 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2007, and another $1 billion loss in the 
first quarter of 2008.   
 
 
earnings, and liquidity, OTS and the FDIC lowered the bank’s safety and soundness rating to a 3 
on a scale of 1 to 5, signaling it was a troubled institution.130  In March 2008, at the request of 
OTS and the FDIC, Washington Mutual allowed several potential buyers of the bank to review 
its financial information.131  JPMorgan Chase followed with a purchase offer that WaMu 
declined.132 Instead, in April 2008, Washington Mutual’s parent holding company raised $7 
billion in new capital and provided $3 billion of those funds to the bank.133  By June, the bank 
had shut down its wholesale lending channel.134  It also closed over 180 loan centers and 
terminated 3,000 employees.135  In addition, WaMu reduced its dividend to shareholders.136
 

In February 2008, based upon increasing deterioration in the bank’s asset quality, 

   

In July 2008, a $30 billion subprime mortgage lender, IndyMac, failed and was placed 

into receivership by the government.  In response, depositors became concerned about 
Washington Mutual and withdrew over $10 billion in deposits, putting pressure on the bank’s 
liquidity.  After the bank disclosed a $3.2 billion loss for the second quarter, its stock price 
continued to drop, and more deposits left.

On September 8, 2008, Washington Mutual signed a public Memorandum of 

Understanding that it had negotiated with OTS and the FDIC to address the problems affecting 
the bank.  Longtime CEO Kerry Killinger was forced to leave the bank, accepting a $15 million 
severance payment.137

  Allen Fishman was appointed his replacement.   

 
On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy.  Three days later, on 

 
September 18, OTS and the FDIC lowered Washington Mutual’s rating to a “4,” indicating that a 
bank failure was a possibility.  The credit rating agencies also downgraded the credit ratings of 
the bank and its parent holding company.  Over the span of eight days starting on September 15, 
nearly $17 billion in deposits left the bank.  At that time, the Deposit Insurance Fund contained 
about $45 billion, an amount which could have been exhausted by the failure of a $300 billion 
institution like Washington Mutual.  As the financial crisis worsened each day, regulatory 
concerns about the bank’s liquidity and viability intensified. 
 
 
close the bank.  Unable to wait for a Friday, the day on which most banks are closed, the 
agencies acted on a Thursday, September 25, 2008, which was also the 119th anniversary of 
WaMu’s founding.  That day, OTS seized Washington Mutual Bank, placed it into receivership, 
and appointed the FDIC as the receiver.  The FDIC facilitated its immediate sale to JPMorgan 
Chase for $1.9 billion.  The sale eliminated the need to draw upon the Deposit Insurance Fund.  
WaMu’s parent, Washington Mutual, Inc., declared bankruptcy soon after. 
 

Because of its liquidity problems and poor quality assets, OTS and the FDIC decided to 

C.   High Risk Lending Strategy   

 

In 2004, Washington Mutual ramped up high risk home loan originations to borrowers 

that had not traditionally qualified for them.  The following year, Washington Mutual adopted a 
high risk strategy to issue high risk mortgages, and then mitigate some of that risk by selling or 
securitizing many of the loans.  When housing prices stopped climbing in late 2006, a large 
number of those risky loans began incurring extraordinary rates of delinquency as did the 
securities that relied on those loans for cash flow.  In 2007, the problems with WaMu’s High 
Risk Lending Strategy worsened, as delinquencies increased, the securitization market dried up, 
and the bank was unable to find buyers for its high risk loans or related securities. 
 

The formal initiation of WaMu’s High Risk Lending Strategy can be dated to January 
2005, when a specific proposal was presented to the WaMu Board of Directors for approval.138
WaMu adopted this strategy because its executives calculated that high risk home loans were 
more profitable than low risk loans, not only because the bank could charge borrowers higher 
interest rates and fees, but also because higher risk loans received higher prices when securitized 
and sold to investors.  They garnered higher prices because, due to their higher risk, the 
securities paid a higher coupon rate than other comparably rated securities.

59 

 

Over a five-year period from 2003 to 2008, Washington Mutual Bank shifted its loan 

originations from primarily traditional 30-year fixed and government backed loans to primarily 
higher risk home loans.  This shift included increased subprime loan activity at Long Beach, 
more subprime loans purchased through its Specialty Mortgage Finance correspondent channel, 
and more bulk purchases of subprime loans through its conduit channel for use in securitizations.  
WaMu also increased its originations and acquisitions of Option ARM, Alt A, and home equity 
loans.  While the shift began earlier, the strategic decision to move toward higher risk loans was 
not fully articulated to regulators or the Board of Directors until the end of 2004 and the 
beginning of 2005.139
 

 

In about three years, from 2005 to 2007, WaMu issued hundreds of billions of higher risk 

loans, including $49 billion in subprime loans140 and $59 billion in Option ARMs.141  Data 
compiled by the Treasury and the FDIC Inspectors General showed that, by the end of 2007, 
Option ARMs constituted about 47% of all home loans on WaMu’s balance sheet and home 
equity loans made up $63.5 billion or 27% of its home loan portfolio, a 130% increase from 
2003.142  According to an August 2006 internal WaMu presentation on Option ARM credit risk, 
from 1999 until 2006, Option ARM borrowers selected the minimum monthly payment more 
than 95% of the time.143  The data also showed that at the end of 2007, 84% of the total value of 
the Option ARMs was negatively amortizing, meaning that the borrowers were going into deeper 
debt rather than paying off their loan balances.144  In addition, by the end of 2007, stated income 
loans – loans in which the bank had not verified the borrower’s income – represented 73% of 
WaMu’s Option ARMs, 50% of its subprime loans, and 90% of its home equity loans.145  WaMu 
also originated numerous loans with high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, in which the loan amount 
exceeded 80% of the value of the underlying property.  The Treasury and the FDIC Inspectors 
General determined, for example, that 44% of WaMu’s subprime loans and 35% of its home 
equity loans had LTV ratios in excess of 80%.146  Still another problem was that WaMu had high 
geographic concentrations of its home loans in California and Florida, states that ended up 
suffering above-average home value depreciation.147

(1) Strategic Direction 

60 

 
 
 

In 2004, WaMu set the stage for its High Risk Lending Strategy by formally adopting 
aggressive financial targets for the upcoming five-year time period.  The new earnings targets 
created pressure for the bank to shift from its more conservative practices toward practices that 
carried more risk.  Mr. Killinger described those targets in a June 2004 “Strategic Direction” 
memorandum to WaMu’s Board of Directors:  “Our primary financial targets for the next five 
years will be to achieve an average ROE [Return on Equity] of at least 18%, and average EPS 
[Earnings Per Share] growth of at least 13%.”148
predicted continuing growth opportunities for the bank: 
 

  In his memorandum to the Board, Mr. Killinger 

“In a consolidating industry, it is appropriate to continually assess if shareholder value 
creation is best achieved by selling for a short-term change of control premium or to 
continue to build long-term value as an independent company.  We believe remaining an 
independent company is appropriate at this time because of substantial growth 
opportunities we see ahead.  We are especially encouraged with growth prospects for our 
consumer banking group.  We would also note that our stock is currently trading at a 
price which we believe is substantially below the intrinsic value of our unique franchise.  
This makes it even more important to stay focused on building long-term shareholder 
value, diligently protecting our shareholders from inadequate unsolicited takeover 
proposals and maintaining our long held position of remaining an independent 
company.”149

 

 

 

Mr. Killinger identified residential nonprime and adjustable rate mortgage loans as one of the 
primary bank businesses driving balance sheet growth.150  Mr. Killinger also stated in the 
memorandum:  “Wholesale and correspondent will be nationwide and retooled to deliver higher 
margin products.”151
 
 
 

(2)  Approval of Strategy 

After 2002, Washington Mutual stopped acquiring lenders specializing in residential 
 and embarked upon a new strategy to push the company’s growth, focused on 

mortgages,152
increasing its issuance and purchase of higher risk home loans.  OTS took note of this strategy in 
WaMu’s 2004 Report on Examination:

Direction,” JPM_WM05385579 at 581. 
149 Id. at 582. 
150 Id. 
151 Id. at 585. 
152 The only new lender that Washington Mutual acquired after 2004 was Commercial Capital Bancorp in 2006. 

61 

“Management provided us with a copy of the framework for WMI’s 5-year (2005-2009) 
strategic plan [which] contemplates asset growth of at least 10% a year, with assets 
increasing to near $500 billion by 2009.”153

 

 

 

 

In response, in January 2005, WaMu management developed a document entitled, 

OTS directed the bank to spell out its new lending strategy in a written document that had to be 
presented to and gain approval by the WaMu Board of Directors.154
 
 
“Higher Risk Lending Strategy” and presented it to its Board of Directors for approval to shift 
the bank’s focus from originating low risk fixed rate and government backed loans to higher risk 
subprime, home equity, and Option ARM loans.155  The Strategy disclosed that WaMu planned 
to increase both its issuance of higher risk loans and its offering of loans to higher risk 
borrowers.  The explicit reasoning for the shift was the increased profitability of the higher risk 
loans, measured by actual bank data showing that those loans produced a higher “gain on sale” 
or profit for the bank compared to lower risk loans.  For example, one chart supporting the 
Strategy showed that selling subprime loans garnered more than eight times the gain on sale as 
government backed loans.156
 

 

The WaMu submission to the Board noted that, in order for the plan to be successful, 

WaMu would need to carefully manage its residential mortgage business as well as its credit risk, 
meaning the risk that borrowers would not repay the higher risk loans.157  During the Board’s 
discussion of the strategy, credit officers noted that losses would likely lag by several years.158
  
These documents show that WaMu knew that, even if loan losses did not immediately come to 
pass after initiating the High Risk Lending Strategy, it did not mean the strategy was free of 
problems.

(3) Definition of High Risk Lending 
 
As part of the 2005 presentation to the Board of Directors outlining the strategy, OTS 

recommended that WaMu define higher risk lending.159
contained a slide defining “Higher Risk Lending”: 

  The January 2005 presentation 

 

While the January 2005 presentation promised to present a fuller definition of higher risk 

A footnote on the slide defined “low credit scores” as less than a 620 FICO score for first lien 
single family residence mortgages, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit.  It 
defined low credit scores as less than 660 for second lien home equity loans (HEL) and home 
equity lines of credit (HELOC), and other consumer loans.161
 
 
loans for Board approval at some future date, a more complete definition had already been 
provided to the Board a few weeks earlier in a December 21, 2004 presentation entitled, “Asset 
Allocation Initiative: Higher Risk Lending Strategy and Increased Credit Risk Management.”162
  
This presentation contained the same basic definition of higher risk borrowers, but also provided 
a definition of higher risk loans.   
 

Higher risk loans were defined as single family residence mortgages with a loan-to-value 
(LTV) ratio of equal to or greater than 90% if not credit enhanced, or a combined-loan-to-value 
(CLTV) ratio of 95%.  These numbers are a notable departure from the 80% LTV ratio

value based on the changes in the interest rate.  Fixed rate loans, in particular, incurred 
significant interest rate risk, because on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, for example, WaMu 
agreed to receive interest payments at a certain rate for 30 years, but if the prevailing interest rate 
went up, WaMu’s cost of money increased and the relative value of the fixed mortgages on its 
balance sheet went down.  WaMu used various strategies to hedge its interest rate risk.  One way 
to incur less interest rate risk was for WaMu to hold loans with variable interest rates, such as 
Hybrid ARMs typical of WaMu’s subprime lending, or Option ARMs, WaMu’s flagship “prime” 
product.  These adjustable rate mortgages paid interest rates that, after the initial fixed rate period 
expired, were typically pegged to the Cost of Funds Index (COFI) or the Monthly Treasury 
Average (MTA), two common measures of prevailing interest rates.

(4)  Gain on Sale 

 

64 

WaMu’s internal documents indicate that the primary motivation behind its High Risk 

 
Lending Strategy was the superior “gain on sale” profits generated by high risk loans.167
Washington Mutual management had calculated that higher risk loans were more profitable 
when sold or securitized.  Prior to sale, higher risk loans also produced greater short term profits, 
because the bank typically charged the borrowers a higher rate of interest and higher fees.   

  

 
Higher risk home loans placed for sale were more profitable for WaMu, because of the 

higher price that Wall Street underwriters and investors were willing to pay for them.  The profit 
that WaMu obtained by selling or securitizing a loan was known as the “gain on sale.”  Gain on 
sale figures for the loans produced by the bank were analyzed and presented to the WaMu Board 
of Directors.  On April 18, 2006, David Schneider, the President of WaMu Home Loans division, 
provided the Board of Directors a confidential presentation entitled, “Home Loans 
Discussion.”168  The third slide in the presentation was entitled, “Home Loans Strategic 
Positioning,” and stated:  “Home Loans is accelerating significant business model changes to 
achieve consistent, long term financial objectives.”169  Beneath this heading the first listed 
objective was:  “Shift from low-margin business to high-margin products,”170
profitable to more profitable loan products.  The next slide in the presentation was entitled:  
“Shift to Higher Margin Products,” and elaborated on that objective.  The slide listed the actual 
gain on sale obtained by the bank, in 2005, for each type of loan WaMu offered, providing the 
“basis points” (bps) that each type of loan fetched on Wall Street:

Mr. Schneider told the Subcommittee that the numbers listed on the chart were not 

projections, but the numbers generated from actual, historical loan data.172
  As the chart makes 
clear, the least profitable loans for WaMu were government backed and fixed rate loans.  Those 
loans were typically purchased by the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac which paid relatively low prices for them.  Instead of focusing on those low margin 
loans, WaMu’s management looked to make profits elsewhere, and elected to focus on the most 
profitable loans, which were the Option ARM, home equity, and subprime loans.  In 2005, 
subprime loans, with 150 basis points, were eight times more profitable than a fixed rate loan at 
19 basis points and more than 10 times as profitable as government backed loans.   

 
The gain on sale data WaMu collected drove not only WaMu’s decision to focus on 

higher risk home loans, but also how the bank priced those loans for borrowers.  In determining 
how much it would charge for a loan, the bank calculated first what price the loan would obtain 
on Wall Street.  As Mr. Beck explained in his testimony before the Subcommittee: 

 
“Because WaMu’s capital markets organization was engaged in the secondary mortgage 
market, it had ready access to information regarding how the market priced loan 
products.  Therefore my team helped determine the initial prices at which WaMu could 
offer loans by beginning with the applicable market prices for private or agency-backed 
mortgage securities and adding the various costs WaMu incurred in the origination, sale, 
and servicing of home loans.”173
 
(5)  Acknowledging Unsustainable Housing Price Increases  

 

In 2004, before WaMu implemented its High Risk Lending Strategy, the Chief Risk 

 
 
Officer Jim Vanasek expressed internally concern about the unsustainable rise in housing prices, 
loosening lending standards, and the possible consequences.  On September 2, 2004, just months 
before the formal presentation of the High Risk Lending Strategy to the Board of Directors, Mr. 
Vanasek circulated a prescient memorandum to WaMu’s mortgage underwriting and appraisal 
staff, warning of a bubble in housing prices and encouraging tighter underwriting.  The 
memorandum also captured a sense of the turmoil and pressure at WaMu.  Under the subject 
heading, “Perspective,” Mr. Vanasek wrote: 
 

“I want to share just a few thoughts with all of you as we begin the month of September.  
Clearly you have gone through a difficult period of time with all of the changes in the 
mortgage area of the bank.  Staff cuts and recent defections have only added to the stress.  
Mark Hillis [a Senior Risk Officer] and I are painfully aware of the toll that this has taken 
on some of you and have felt it is important to tell you that we recognize it has been and 
continues to be difficult.

“In the midst of all this change and stress, patience is growing thin. We understand that.  
We also know that loan originators are pushing very hard for deals.  But we need to put 
all of this in perspective. 

“At this point in the mortgage cycle with prices having increased far beyond the rate of 
increase in personal incomes, there clearly comes a time when prices must slow down or 
perhaps even decline.  There have been so many warnings of a Housing Bubble that we 
all tend now to ignore them because thus far it has not happened.  I am not in the business 
of forecasting, but I have a healthy respect for the underlying data which says ultimately 
this environment is no longer sustainable.  Therefore I would conclude that now is not the 
time to be pushing appraisal values.  If anything we should be a bit more conservative 
across the board.  Kerry Killinger and Bill Longbrake [a Vice Chair of WaMu] have both 
expressed renewed concern over this issue. 
 
“This is a point where we should be much more careful about exceptions.  It is highly 
questionable as to how strong this economy may be; there is clearly no consensus on 
Wall Street.  If the economy stalls, the combination of low FICOs, high LTVs and 
inordinate numbers of exceptions will come back to haunt us.”174
 

 

Mr. Vanasek was the senior-most risk officer at WaMu, and had frequent interactions with Mr. 
Killinger and the Board of Directors.  While his concerns may have been heard, they were not 
heeded.   
 
Mr. Vanasek told the Subcommittee that, because of his predictions of a collapse in the 

housing market, he earned the derisive nickname “Dr. Doom.”175  But evidence of a housing 
bubble was overwhelming by 2005.  Over the prior ten years, housing prices had skyrocketed in 
an unprecedented fashion, as the following chart prepared by Paulson & Co. Inc., based on data 
from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, 
demonstrates.176

Mr. Vanasek shared his concerns with Mr. Killinger.  At the Subcommittee’s hearing, 
Mr. Killinger testified:  “Now, beginning in 2005, 2 years before the financial crisis hit, I was 
publicly and repeatedly warning of the risks of a potential housing downturn.”177
  In March 
2005, he engaged in an email exchange with Mr. Vanasek, in which both agreed the United 
States was in the midst of a housing bubble.  On March, 10, 2005, Mr. Vanasek emailed Mr. 
Killinger about many of the issues facing his risk management team, concluding: 
 

 

“My group is working as hard as I can reasonably ask any group to work and in several 
cases they are stretched to the absolute limit.  Any words of support and appreciation 
would be very helpful to the morale of the group.  These folks have stepped up to fixing 
any number of issues this year, many not at all of their own making.”178

 

 
Mr. Killinger replied: 
 

“Thanks Jim.  Overall, it appears we are making some good progress.  Hopefully, the 
Regulators will agree that we are making some progress.  I suspect the toughest thing for 
us will be to navigate through a period of high home prices, increased competitive 
conditions for reduced underwriting standards, and our need to grow the balance sheet.  I

have never seen such a high risk housing market as market after market thinks they are 
unique and for whatever reason are not likely to experience price declines.  This typically 
signifies a bubble.” 

 

 

Mr. Vanasek agreed: 
 

“I could not agree more.  All the classic signs are there and the likely outcome is 
probably not great.  We would all like to think the air can come out of the balloon slowly 
but history would not lean you in that direction.  Over the next month or so I am going to 
work hard on what I hope can be a lasting mechanism (legacy) for determining how 
much risk we can afford to take ….” 
 

Despite Mr. Killinger’s awareness that housing prices were unsustainable, could drop suddenly, 
and could make it difficult for borrowers to refinance or sell their homes, Mr. Killinger 
continued to push forward with WaMu’s High Risk Lending Strategy. 

 
(6) Execution of the High Risk Lending Strategy 
 
WaMu formally adopted the High Risk Lending Strategy in January 2005.179

  Over the 

following two years, management significantly shifted the bank’s loan originations towards 
riskier loans as called for in the plan, but had to slow down the pace of implementation in the 
face of worsening market conditions.  In retrospect, WaMu executives tried to portray their 
inability to fully execute the plan as a strategic choice rather than the result of a failed strategy.  
For example, Mr. Killinger testified at the Subcommittee hearing that the bank’s High Risk 
Lending Strategy was only contemplated, but not really executed:  

 
“First, we had an adjustment in our strategy that started in about 2004 to gradually 
increase the amount of home equity, subprime, commercial real estate, and multi-family 
loans that we could hold on the balance sheet.  We had that long-term strategy, but … we 
quickly determined that the housing market was increasing in its risk, and we put most of 
those strategies for expansion on hold.”180
 

   

Mr. Killinger’s claim that the High Risk Lending Strategy was put “on hold” is contradicted, 
however, by WaMu’s SEC filings, its internal documents, and the testimony of other WaMu 
executives. 

 
Washington Mutual’s SEC filings contain loan origination and acquisition data showing 

that the bank did implement its High Risk Lending Strategy.  Although rising defaults and the 
2007 collapse of the subprime secondary market prevented WaMu from fully executing its plans, 
WaMu dramatically shifted the composition of the loans it originated and purchased, nearly

doubling the percentage of higher risk home loans from 36% to 67%.  The following chart, 
prepared by the Subcommittee using data from WaMu’s SEC filings, demonstrates the shift.181 

69 

In 2003, 64% of WaMu’s mortgage originations and purchases were fixed rate loans, and 

 
 
only 19% were subprime, Option ARM, or home equity loans.  In 2004, 31% of WaMu’s 
mortgage originations and purchases were fixed rate loans, and 55% were subprime, Option 
ARM, or home equity loans.  In 2005, 31% of WaMu’s mortgage originations and purchases 
were fixed rate loans, and 56% were subprime, Option ARM, or equity loans.  By 2006, only 
25% of WaMu’s mortgage originations and purchases were fixed rate loans, and 55% were 
subprime, Option ARM, or home equity loans.182  Even after market forces began taking their 
toll in 2007, and WaMu ended all subprime lending in the fall of that year, its higher risk 
originations and purchases at 47% were double its fixed rate loans at 23%.183

Mr. Killinger’s annual “Strategic Direction” memoranda to the Board in 2005, 2006, and 

 
 
2007, also contradict his testimony that the strategy of expanding high risk lending was put on 
hold.  On the first page of his 2005 memorandum, Mr. Killinger wrote:  “We continue to see 
excellent long-term growth opportunities for our key business lines of retail banking, mortgage 
banking, multi-family lending and sub-prime residential lending.”184
  Rather than hold back on 
WaMu’s stated strategy of risk expansion, Mr. Killinger told the Board that WaMu should 
accelerate it: 
 

“In order to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our business, we have 
accelerated development of Alt-A, government and sub-prime loan products, as well as 
hybrid ARMs and other prime products, specifically for delivery through retail, 
wholesale and correspondent channels.”185

 

 

 

The 2005 strategic direction memorandum also targeted Long Beach for expansion: 
 

“Long Beach is expected to originate $30 billion of loans this year, growing to $36 
billion in 2006.  To facilitate this growth, we plan to increase account managers by 100.  
We expect Long Beach to have 5% of the sub-prime market in 2005, growing to [a] 6% 
share in 2006.”186

 

Despite warning against unsustainable housing prices in March 2005, Mr. Killinger’s 

 
 
2006 “Strategic Direction” memorandum to the Board put even more emphasis on growth than 
the 2005 memorandum.  After reviewing the financial targets set in the five-year plan adopted in 
2004, Mr. Killinger wrote:  “To achieve these targets, we developed aggressive business plans 
around the themes of growth, productivity, innovation, risk management and people 
development.”187
high risk home lending strategy was still operative in 2006.  The memorandum stated: 
 

  His memorandum expressed no hesitation or qualification as to whether the 

“Finally, our Home Loan Group should complete its repositioning within the next twelve 
months and it should then be in position to grow its market share of Option ARM, home 
equity, sub prime and Alt. A loans.  We should be able to increase our share of these 
categories to over 10%.”188

 

Contrary to Mr. Killinger’s hearing testimony, the 2006 memorandum indicates an expansion of 
WaMu’s high risk home lending, rather than any curtailment: 
 

“We are refining our home loans business model to significantly curtail low margin 
Government and conventional fixed rate originations and servicing, and to significantly

increase our origination and servicing of high margin home equity, Alt. A, sub prime and 
option ARMs.  Action steps include merging Longbeach sub prime and the prime 
business under common management, merging correspondent activities into our 
correspondent channel, getting out of Government lending, curtailing conventional fixed 
rate production, expanding distribution of targeted high margin products through all 
distribution channels and potentially selling MSRs [Mortgage Servicing Rights] of low 
margin products.  We expect these actions to result in significantly higher profitability 
and lower volatility over time.”189

 

 

The April 16, 2006 “Home Loans Discussion” presentation by Home Loans President 

 
David Schneider, discussed above, also confirms WaMu’s ongoing efforts to shift its loan 
business toward high risk lending.  Page four of that presentation, entitled, “Shift to Higher 
Margin Products,” shows two pie charts under the heading, “WaMu Volume by Product.”190
One chart depicts loan volume for 2005, and the second chart depicts projected loan volume for 
2008:

These charts demonstrate WaMu’s intention to increase its loan originations over three 

years by almost $30 billion, focusing on increases in high risk loan products.  Subprime 
originations, for example, were expected to grow from $34 billion in 2005 to $70 billion in 2008; 
Alt A originations were projected to grow from $1 billion in 2005 to $24 billion in 2008; and

Home Equity originations were projected to grow from $4 billion in 2005 to $30 billion in 2008.  
On the other hand, WaMu’s low risk originations were expected to be curtailed dramatically. 
Government backed loan originations, which totaled $8 billion in 2005, were projected to be 
eliminated by 2008.  Fixed rate loan originations were projected to decline from $69 billion in 
2005 to $4 billion in 2008.  
 

The 2007 “Strategic Direction” memorandum to the Board is dated June 18, 2007, well 

after U.S. housing prices had begun to decline, as Mr. Killinger acknowledged: 
 

“For the past two years, we have been predicting the bursting of the housing bubble and 
the likelihood of a slowing housing market.  This scenario has now turned into a reality.  
Housing prices are declining in many areas of the country and sales are rapidly slowing.  
This is leading to an increase in delinquencies and loan losses.  The sub-prime market 
was especially rocked as many sub-prime borrowers bought houses at the peak of the 
cycle and now find their houses are worth less and they are having difficulties refinancing 
their initial low-rate loans.”192

 

 
While the memorandum’s section on home loan strategy no longer focused on overall growth, it 
continued to push the shift to high risk lending, despite problems in the subprime market: 
 

“Home Loans is a large and important business, but at this point in the cycle, it is 
unprofitable.  The key strategy for 2008 is to execute on the revised strategy adopted in 
2006. …  We need to optimize the sub-prime and prime distribution channels with 
particular emphasis on growing the retail banking, home loan center and consumer direct 
channels.  We also expect to portfolio more of Home Loans’ originations in 2008, 
including the new Mortgage Plus product.  We will continue to emphasize higher-risk 
adjusted return products such as home equity, sub-prime first mortgages, Alt A 
mortgages and proprietary products such as Mortgage Plus.”193

 

The testimony of other WaMu executives further confirms the bank’s implementation of 

 
 
its High Risk Lending Strategy.  Ronald Cathcart, who joined WaMu in 2006, to become the 
company’s Chief Risk Officer, testified: 
 

“The company’s strategic plan to shift its portfolios towards higher margin products was 
already underway when I arrived at WaMu.  Basically, this strategy involved moving 
away from traditional mortgage lending into alternative lending programs involving 
adjustable-rate mortgages as well as into subprime products.  The strategic shift to

securities that: “WaMu is focusing on higher margin products”). 

 

 

higher-margin products resulted in the bank taking on a higher degree of credit risk 
because there was a greater chance that borrowers would default.”194

 

73 

Likewise, Steven Rotella, WaMu’s President and Chief Operating Officer, who began with the 
bank in January 2005, testified before the Subcommittee: 
 

“In particular, I want to be very clear on the topic of high-risk lending, this 
Subcommittee’s focus today.  High-risk mortgage lending in WaMu’s case, primarily 
Option ARMs and subprime loans through Long Beach Mortgage, a subsidiary of WaMu, 
were expanded and accelerated at explosive rates starting in the early 2000s, prior to my 
hiring in 2005….  In 2004 alone, the year before I joined, Option ARMs were up 124 
[percent], and subprime lending was up 52 percent.”195
 
In his testimony, Mr. Rotella took credit for curtailing WaMu’s growth and high risk 

  

   

Mr. Killinger replied by email the next day:  “Regarding Longbeach, I think there is a 

 
lending.196  Mr. Rotella’s own emails, however, show that he supported the High Risk Lending 
Strategy.  On October 15, 2005, Mr. Rotella emailed Mr. Killinger about WaMu’s 2006 strategic 
plan:  “I think our focus needs to be on organic growth of home eq, and subprime, and greater 
utilization of [the Home Loans division] as we know it today to facilitate that at lower 
acquisition costs and greater efficiency.”197
 
 
good opportunity to be a low cost provider and gain significant share when the industry 
implodes.”198  Responding to Mr. Rotella’s ideas about the Home Loans division, Mr. Killinger 
wrote:  “It makes sense to leverage the home loans distribution channels with home equity, sub 
prime, and alt. A.”199  In this late 2005 email exchange, WaMu’s two senior-most executives 
contemplate reducing prime lending, not subprime.  Mr. Killinger wrote:  “If we can’t make a 
shift in our business model, we might be better off exiting the prime space.”200
 
 
Mr. Rotella replied to Mr. Killinger’s email later on October 16, 2005.  He continued to 
emphasize the importance of focusing on high risk lending, referring to his previous experience 
as a mortgage banker at JPMorgan Chase: 
 

 

“We did these kinds of analyses all the time at Chase which led us to run as fast as we 
could into home eq, alt a, subprime (our investment banking brethren stopped us from 
going too far here).  We viewed prime as a source of scale benefits in servicing for the 
other areas and a conduit of higher margin product and aimed to hold our prime servicing

flat to down.  I feel strongly that where we need to land is a new home loan unit that 
includes prime, heq, and subprime.  It is a far superior model.”201

 

 
 
In July 2008, just two months before the collapse of WaMu, Home Loans President 
David Schneider prepared an internal presentation entitled, “Home Loans Story, External & 
Internal Views.”202
  The presentation was retrospective, providing timelines of WaMu’s major 
strategy, policy, and personnel changes.  The first substantive page of the presentation bears the 
heading, “Three fundamental business shifts occurred in Home Loans this millennium which 
shaped its performance and position in a volatile competitive landscape”: 
 

“2001 to 2005 
‘Mono-line’ business model focused on generating high volume of low-margin, prime 
products …. 

 

 

 

 

2006 
Targeted production franchise toward higher margin products to become a market leader 
in specific product segments …. 

2007 & Beyond 
Subprime mortgage implosion fuels credit and liquidity crisis and the non-agency 
secondary market disappears[.]” 

Mr. Scheider’s retrospective presentation of the changes that occurred at WaMu is 
unambiguous:  by 2006, WaMu had “[t]argeted production franchise toward higher margin 
products.”203  According to the same presentation, that model change also lowered earnings 
volatility for WaMu by lessening exposure to Mortgage Servicing Rights.204  Later slides provide 
more detail.  A quarterly timeline is presented with the heading:  “In an environment of internal 
and external large-scale change, Home Loans took bold actions to redefine its business into a 
sustainable model.”  In the strategy section for the second quarter of 2006, Mr. Schneider wrote:  
“New business model, high margin products.”205
 

Despite warnings by some within its management about unsustainable housing prices, 
WaMu pursued a High Risk Lending Strategy to generate short term profits from the favorable 
gain-on-sale margins offered by Wall Street for high risk loans and securitizations, for which the 
credit rating agencies continued to award AAA ratings.  To succeed, the strategy was premised 
upon borrowers being able to refinance or sell their homes to pay off their loans in the event of a 
default.  Stagnant or declining house prices made refinancing and home sales more difficult.

Effective implementation of the High Risk Lending Strategy also required robust risk 
management.  But while WaMu was incurring significantly more credit risk than it had in the 
past, risk managers were marginalized, undermined, and subordinated to WaMu’s business units.  
As a result, when credit risk management was most needed, WaMu found itself lacking in 
effective risk management and oversight. 

 
D.  Shoddy Lending Practices   

At the same time they increased their higher risk lending, WaMu and Long Beach 

engaged in a host of poor lending practices that produced billions of dollars in poor quality loans.  
Those practices included offering high risk borrowers large loans; steering borrowers to higher 
risk loans; accepting loan applications without verifying the borrower’s income; using loans with 
low teaser rates to entice borrowers to take out larger loans; promoting negative amortization 
loans which led to many borrowers increasing rather than paying down their debt over time; and 
authorizing loans with multiple layers of risk.  WaMu and Long Beach also exercised weak 
oversight over their loan personnel and third party mortgage brokers, and tolerated the issuance 
of loans with fraudulent or erroneous borrower information.   

 
(1) Long Beach 
 
Throughout the period reviewed by the Subcommittee, from 2004 until its demise in 

September 2007, Long Beach was plagued with problems.  Long Beach was one of the largest 
subprime lenders in the United States,206
 but it did not have any of its own loan officers.  Long 
Beach operated exclusively as a “wholesale lender,” meaning all of the loans it issued were 
obtained from third party mortgage brokers who had brought loans to the company to be 
financed.  Long Beach “account executives” solicited and originated the mortgages that were 
initiated by mortgage brokers working directly with borrowers.  Long Beach account executives 
were paid according to the volume of loans they originated, with little heed paid to loan quality. 

 
Throughout the period reviewed by the Subcommittee, Long Beach’s subprime home 

loans and mortgage backed securities were among the worst performing in the subprime 
industry.  Its loans repeatedly experienced early payment defaults, its securities had among the 
highest delinquencies in the market, and its unexpected losses and repurchase demands damaged 
its parent corporation’s financial results.  Internal documentation from WaMu shows that senior 
management at the bank was fully aware of Long Beach’s shoddy lending practices, but failed to 
correct them. 

 
2003 Halt in Securitizations.  For a brief period in 2003, Long Beach was required by 

WaMu lawyers to stop all securitizations until significant performance problems were remedied.  
While the problems were addressed and securitizations later resumed, many of the issues 
returned and lingered for several years. 

 

                                                 
206 See 1/2007 Washington Mutual Presentation, “Subprime Mortgage Program,” Hearing Exhibit 4/13-5 (slide 
showing Long Beach Annual Origination Volume). 

76 

 

The problems with Long Beach’s loans and securitizations predated the company’s 
purchase by WaMu in 1999, but continued after the purchase.  An internal email at WaMu’s 
primary federal regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), observed the following with 
respect to Long Beach’s mortgage backed securities: 

 
“Performance data for 2003 and 2004 vintages appear to approximate industry average 
while issues prior to 2003 have horrible performance.  LBMC finished in the top 12 worst 
annualized NCLs [net credit losses] in 1997 and 1999 thru 2003.  LBMC nailed down the 
worst spot at top loser … in 2000 and placed 3rd in 2001.”207
 
In 2003, Long Beach’s performance deteriorated to the point that WaMu’s legal 
department put a stop to all Long Beach securitizations until the company improved its 
operations.208  An internal review of Long Beach’s first quarter 2003 lending “concluded that 
40% (109 of 271) of loans reviewed were considered unacceptable due to one or more critical 
errors.”209  According to a 2003 joint report issued by regulators from the FDIC and Washington 
State:  “This raised concerns over LBMC’s ability to meet the representations and warrant[ies] 
made to facilitate sales of loan securitizations, and management halted securitization activity.”210  
A Long Beach corporate credit review in August 2003 confirmed that “credit management and 
portfolio oversight practices were unsatisfactory.”211

  

 

 
As a result of the halt in securitizations, Long Beach had to hold loans on its warehouse 

balance sheet, which increased by approximately $1 billion per month and reached nearly $5 
billion by the end of November 2003.  Long Beach had to borrow money from WaMu and other 
creditors to finance the surge.212  The joint visitation report noted that unless Long Beach 
executed a $3 billion securitization by January 2004, “liquidity will be strained.”213  WaMu 
initiated a review of Long Beach led by its General Counsel Faye Chapman.214  Her team 
evaluated the loans that had accumulated during the halt in securitizations.  The joint visitation 
report noted that of 4,000 Long Beach loans reviewed by WaMu by the end of November 2003, 
less than one quarter, about 950, could be sold to investors, another 800 were unsaleable, and the 
rest – over half of the loans – had deficiencies that had to be remediated before a sale could take 
place.215

After a short hiatus, WaMu allowed Long Beach to resume securitizing subprime loans in 
  An internal WaMu memorandum, later prepared by a WaMu risk officer who had been 

2004.216
asked to review Long Beach in 2004, recalled significant problems:   

 
“You’ve asked for a chronological recap of ERM [Enterprise Risk Management] market 
risk involvement with Longbeach and the sub prime conduit.  … [In] 2004:  I conducted 
an informal but fairly intensive market risk audit of Longbeach ….  The climate was very 
adversarial. … We found a total mess.”217

   

A November 2004 email exchange between two WaMu risk officers provides a sense that 

poor quality loans were still a problem.  The first WaMu risk officer wrote: 
 

77 

“Just a heads-up that you may be getting some outreach from Carroll Moseley (or 
perhaps someone higher up in the chain) at Long Beach regarding their interest in 
exploring the transfer of … a small amount (maybe $10-20mm in UPB [unpaid principal 
balance]) of Piggieback ‘seconds’ (our favorite toxic combo of low FICO borrower and 
HLTV loan) from HFS [hold for sale portfolio] to HFI [hold for investment portfolio]. 
 
“As Carroll described the situation, these are of such dubious credit quality that they 
can’t possibly be sold for anything close to their ‘value’ if we held on to them. …  I urged 
him to reach out to you directly on these questions.  (E.g., it’s entirely possible we might 
want to make a business decision to keep a small amount of this crap on our books if it 
was already written down to near zero, but we would want all parties to be clear that no 
precedent was being set for the product as a whole, etc., etc.).”218
 

 

The second risk officer sent the email to the head of Long Beach, with the comment, “I think it 
would be prudent for us to just sell all of these loans.” 
 

 

2005 Early Payment Defaults.  Early in 2005, a number of Long Beach loans 

experienced “early payment defaults,” meaning that the borrower failed to make a payment on 
the loan within three months of the loan being sold to investors.  That a loan would default so 
soon after origination typically indicates that there was a problem in the underwriting process.  
Investors who bought EPD loans often demanded that Long Beach repurchase them, invoking 
the representations and warranties clause in the loan sales agreements.

reviews of LBMC operations led to a decision to temporarily cease securitization activity.  WMU’s Legal 
Department then led a special review of all loans in LBMC’s pipeline and held-for-sale warehouse in order to ensure 
file documentation adequately supported securitization representations and warranties and that WMI was not 
exposed to a potentially significant contingent liability.  Securitization activity was reinstated in early 2004 after the 
Legal Department concluded there was not a significant liability issue.”).

To analyze what happened, WaMu conducted a “post mortem” review of 213 Long 

Beach loans that experienced first payment defaults in March, April, and May of 2005.219
review found that many early defaults were not only preventable, but that in some instances 
fraud should have been easily detected from the presence of “White Out” on an application or a 
borrower having two different signatures: 

  The 

 
“First Payment Defaults (FPD’s) are preventable and / or detectable in nearly all cases 
(~99%)[.]  Most FPD cases (60%) are failure of current control effectiveness[.]  … High 
incident rate of potential fraud among FPD cases[.] … All roles in the origination process 
need to sharpen watch for misrepresentation and fraud[.] …  Underwriting guidelines are 
not consistently followed and conditions are not consistently or effectively met[.] … 
Underwriters are not consistently recognizing non-arm’s length transactions and/or 
underwriting associated risk effectively[.] … Credit Policy does not adequately address 
certain key risk elements in layered high risk transactions[.] … 
 
“66% of reviewed FPD cases had significant variances in the file[.] …  Stated Income 
should be reviewed more closely ([fraud] incidence rate of 35%) ….  Signatures should 
be checked – 14% Borrowers signature vary[.]  Altered documents are usually detectable 
–5% White-out on documentation[.] …  92% of the Purchases reviewed are 100% CLTV 
[combined loan-to-value][.] … 52% are Stated Income.”220
 
A subsequent review conducted by WaMu’s General Auditor of the “root causes” of the 

 

Long Beach loans with early payment defaults pointed not only to lax lending standards and a 
lack of fraud controls, but also to “a push to increase loan volume”: 
 

“In 2004, LBMC [Long Beach] relaxed underwriting guidelines and executed loan sales 
with provisions fundamentally different from previous securitizations.  These changes, 
coupled with breakdowns in manual underwriting processes, were the primary drivers for 
the increase in repurchase volume.  The shift to whole loan sales, including the EPD 
provision, brought to the surface the impact of relaxed credit guidelines, breakdowns in 
manual underwriting processes, and inexperienced subprime personnel.  These factors, 
coupled with a push to increase loan volume and the lack of an automated fraud 
monitoring tool, exacerbated the deterioration in loan quality.”221
 
Due to the early payment defaults, Long Beach was forced to repurchase loans totaling 
  This 

nearly $837 million in unpaid principal, and incurred a net loss of about $107 million.222

were significant enough that Washington Mutual Inc., Long Beach’s parent company, made 
special mention of them in its 2005 10-K filing: 

  These unexpected repurchases 

 
“In 2004 and 2005, the Company’s Long Beach Mortgage Company subsidiary engaged 
in whole loan sale transactions of originated subprime loans in which it agreed to 
repurchase from the investor each ‘early payment default’ loan at a price equal to the 
loan’s face value plus the amount of any premium paid by the investor.  An early 
payment default occurs when the borrower fails to make the first post-sale payment due 
on the loan by a contractually specified date.  Usually when such an event occurs, the fair 
value of the loan at the time of its repurchase is lower than the face value.  In the fourth 
quarter of 2005, the Company experienced increased incidents of repurchases of early 
payment default loans sold by Long Beach Mortgage Company and this trend is expected 
to continue in the first part of 2006.225
 
In addition to the early payment default problem, a September 2005 WaMu audit 

 

observed that at Long Beach, policies designed to mitigate the risk of predatory lending practices 
were not always followed.  The audit report stated:  “In 24 of 27 (88%) of the refinance 
transactions reviewed, policies established to preclude origination of loans providing no net 
tangible benefit to the borrower were not followed.”226  In addition, in 8 out of 10 of the newly 
issued refinance loans that WaMu reviewed, Long Beach had not followed procedures designed 
to detect “loan flipping,” an industry term used to describe the practice of unscrupulous brokers 
or lenders quickly or repeatedly refinancing a borrower’s loan to reap fees and profits but 
provide no benefit to the borrower.227
 

  2006 Purchase of Long Beach.  In response to all the problems at Long Beach, at the 
end of 2005, WaMu fired Long Beach’s senior management and moved the company under the 
direct supervision of the President of WaMu’s Home Loans Division, David Schneider.228  
Washington Mutual promised its regulator, OTS, that Long Beach would improve.229  The bank 
also filed a formal application, requiring OTS approval, to purchase Long Beach from its parent 
company, so that it would become a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank.230
  WaMu told OTS 
that making Long Beach a subsidiary would give the bank greater control over Long Beach’s

operations and allow it to strengthen Long Beach’s lending practices and risk management, as 
well as reduce funding costs and administrative expenses.231  In addition, WaMu proposed that it 
replace its current “Specialty Mortgage Finance” program, which involved purchasing subprime 
loans for its portfolio primarily from Ameriquest, with a similar loan portfolio provided by Long 
Beach.232  OTS had expressed a number of concerns about Long Beach in connection with the 
purchase request,233 but in December 2005, after obtaining commitments from WaMu to 
strengthen Long Beach’s lending and risk management practices, OTS agreed to the purchase.234  
The actual purchase date was March 1, 2006.235

   

Immediately after the purchase, in April 2006, after reviewing Long Beach’s 
operations, WaMu President Rotella sent an email to WaMu CEO Killinger warning 
about the extent of the problems: “[D]elinquencies are up 140% and foreclosures close to 
70%. …  First payment defaults are way up and the 2005 vintage is way up relative to 
previous years. It is ugly.”
would improve:   
 

  Mr. Rotella, however, expressed hope that operations 

236

“Early changes by the new team from HL [Home Loans], who have deep 
subprime experience, indicate a solid opportunity to mitigate some of this.  I 
would expect to see this emerge in 3 to 6 months.  That said, much of the paper 
we originated in the 05 growth spurt was low quality. …  I have the utmost 
confidence in the team overseeing this now and no doubt this unit will be more 
productive and better controlled, but I figured you should know this is not a pretty 
picture right now.  We are all over it, but as we saw with repurchases, there was a 
lot of junk coming in.”  
 
Despite the new management and direct oversight by WaMu’s Home Loans Division, 
Long Beach continued to perform poorly.  Five months later, expected improvements had not 
materialized.  In September 2006, Mr. Rotella sent another email to Mr. Killinger stating that 
Long Beach was still “terrible”: 

 
“[Long Beach] is terrible, in fact negative right now. …  We are being killed by the 
lingering movement of EPDs [early payment defaults] and other credit related issues ….  
[W]e are cleaning up a mess.  Repurchases, EPDs, manual underwriting, very weak 
servicing/collections practices and a weak staff.  Other than that, well you get the 
picture.”237

Again, he expressed hope that the situation would improve:  “The good news is David and his 
team are pros and are all over it.”238  Two months later, in November 2006, however, the head of 
WaMu Capital Markets in New York, David Beck, relayed even more bad news to Mr. 
Schneider, the Home Loans President:  “LBMC [Long Beach] paper is among the worst 
performing in the mkt [market] in 2006.”239
 

Despite the additional focus on improving its lending operations throughout 2006, Long 

Beach was once again flooded with repurchase requests.  According to a memorandum later 
written by an FDIC examination specialist, “[d]uring 2006, more than 5,200 LBMC loans were 
repurchased, totaling $875.3 million.”240  Even though, in January 2006, the bank had ceased 
executing whole loan sales which allowed an automatic repurchase in the event of an EPD, 46% 
of the repurchase volume was as a result of EPDs.  Further, 43% of the repurchase volume 
resulted from first payment defaults (FPDs) in which the borrower missed making the first 
payment on the loan after it was sold.241
violations related to representation and warranties (R&W) not included in the EPD or FPD 
numbers, meaning the violations were identified only later in the life of the loan. 

  Another 10% of the repurchases resulted from 

 
R&W repurchases generally pose a challenge for a bank’s loss reserves, because the 

potential liability – the repurchase request – continues for the life of the loan.  The FDIC 
memorandum observed: 

 
“Management claims that R&W provisions are industry standard and indeed they may be.  
However, I still found that the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement contains some 
representations and warranties worth noting.  For example, not only must the loans be 
‘underwritten in accordance with the seller’s underwriting guideline,’ but the 
‘origination, underwriting, and collection practices used by the seller with respect to each 
mortgage loan have been in all material respects legal, proper, prudent, and customary in 
the subprime mortgage business.’  This provision elevates the potential that investors can 
put back a problem loan years after origination and not only must the loan have been 
underwritten in line with bank guidelines but must also have been underwritten in 
accordance with what is customary with other subprime lenders.”242

 

R&W repurchase requests and loss reserves continued to be an issue at Long Beach.  The 

fourth quarter of 2006 saw another spike in R&W repurchase requests, and in December the 
required amount of R&W loss reserves jumped from $18 million to $76 million.243

On December 22, 2006, the FDIC Dedicated Examiner at WaMu, Steve Funaro, sent an 
email to Mr. Schneider, the Home Loans President, raising questions about the unexpected loan 
defaults and repurchase demands.  He wrote that Long Beach had the “[s]ame issues as FPD last 
quarter  …  Current forecast of 35 to 50m [million] risk.”  His email also noted potentially 
insufficient loss reserves related to WaMu’s own subprime conduit that purchased subprime 
loans from other lenders and mortgage brokers, some of which were going out of business and 
would be unable to shoulder any liability for defaulting loans.  His email noted forecasts of early 
payment defaults totaling $15.6 million and loan delinquencies totaling $10.7 million, in addition 
to other problems, and asked:  “Why the miss? … Who is accountable?”244

   

 
Mr. Schneider forwarded the email to his team and expressed frustration at Long Beach’s 

continuing problems: 

 
“Short story is this is not good. … There is [a] growing potential issue around Long 
Beach repurchases ….  [W]e have a large potential risk from what appears to be a recent 
increase in repurchase requests. …  We are all rapidly losing credibility as a management 
team.”245

  

Performance in 2007 Worsens.  The following year, 2007, was no better as the 

performance of WaMu’s loan portfolio continued to deteriorate.  WaMu’s chief risk officer, Ron 
Cathcart, asked WaMu’s Corporate Credit Review team to assess the quality of Long Beach 
loans and RMBS securities in light of the slowdown and decline in home prices in some areas.246
  
In January 2007, he forwarded an email with the results of the review, which identified “key risk 
issues” related to recent loans and described deteriorating loan performance at Long Beach.  The 
“top five priority issues” were:   

82 

 
“Appraisal deficiencies that could impact value and were not addressed[;]  
Material misrepresentations relating to credit evaluation were confirmed[;]  
Legal documents were missing or contained errors or discrepancies[;]  
Credit evaluation or loan decision errors[; and]  
Required credit documentation was insufficient or missing from the file.”247
 

 

The review also found:  “[D]eterioration was accelerating in recent vintages with each vintage 
since 2002 having performed worse than the prior vintage.”  Mr. Cathcart also expressed concern 
that problems were not being reported to senior management.  He wrote:  “Long Beach 
represents a real problem for WaMu. … I am concerned that Credit Review may seem to have 
been standing on the sidelines while problems continue.  For instance, why have Cathcart, 
Schneider, Rotella and Killinger received NO report on any of this?”248

In February 2007, WaMu senior managers discussed “how best to dispose” of $433 
million in Long Beach performing second lien loans, due to “disarray” in the securitization 
market.249
was “not a viable exit strategy” and noted: 
 

  David Beck, head of WaMu’s Wall Street operation, wrote that securitizing the loans 

“Investors are suffering greater than expected losses from subprime in general as well as 
subprime 2nd lien transactions.  As you know, they are challenging our underwriting 
representations and warrants.  Long Beach was able to securitize 2nd liens once in 2006 
in May.  We sold the BBB- bonds to investors at Libor +260.  To date, that transaction 
has already experienced 7% foreclosures.”250
 

   

WaMu CEO Killinger complained privately to President Steve Rotella: 

 
“Is this basically saying that we are going to lose 15 [percent] on over $400 million of 
this product or 60 million.  That is a pretty bad hit that reflects poorly on credit and others 
responsibility for buying this stuff.  Is this showing up in hits to compensation or 
personnel changes.”251
 

   

WaMu President Rotella responded:   

83 

 
“This is second lien product originated 7-10 months ago from Long Beach. …  In 2006 
Beck’s team started sprinkling seconds in deals as they could.  And, we now have the % 
down to the low single digits, so that we can sell all into our deals (assuming the market 
doesn’t get even worse).”   
 

Also in February 2007, early payment defaults again ticked up.  A review of the first 

He continued:  “In terms of folks losing their jobs, the people largely responsible for bringing us 
this stuff are gone, the senior management of LB.”252
 
 
quarter of 2007 found:  “First payment defaults (FPDs) rose to 1.96% in March but are projected 
to fall back to 1.87% in April based on payments received through May 5th.”253
  It also reported 
that the findings from a “deep dive into February FPDs revealed” that many of the problems 
could have been eliminated had existing guidelines been followed: 
 

 

“The root cause of over 70% of FPDs involved operational issues such as missed fraud 
flags, underwriting errors, and condition clearing errors.  This finding indicates there may 
be opportunities to improve performance without further restricting underwriting 
guidelines.”254

In June 2007, WaMu decided to discontinue Long Beach as a separate entity, and instead 

placed its subprime lending operations in a new WaMu division called “Wholesale Specialty 
Lending.”  That division continued to purchase subprime loans and issue subprime 
securitizations. 

  
Some months later, an internal WaMu review assessed “the effectiveness of the action 

plans developed and implemented by Home Loans to address” the first payment default problem 
in the Wholesale Specialty Lending division.255
  After reviewing 187 FPD loans from November 
2006 through March 2007, the review found: 

 
“The overall system of credit risk management activities and process has major 
weaknesses resulting in unacceptable level of credit risk.  Exposure is considerable and 
immediate corrective action is essential in order to limit or avoid considerable losses, 
reputation damage, or financial statement errors.”256
 

 

In particular, the review found: 
 

“Ineffectiveness of fraud detection tools – 132 of the 187 (71%) files were reviewed … 
for fraud.  [The review] confirmed fraud on 115 [and 17 were] … ‘highly suspect’.  ...  
Credit weakness and underwriting deficiencies is a repeat finding ….  80 of the 112 
(71%) stated income loans were identified for lack of reasonableness of income[.]  133 
(71%) had credit evaluation or loan decision errors ….  58 (31%) had appraisal 
discrepancies or issues that raised concerns that the value was not supported.”257
 
July 2007 was a critical moment not only for WaMu, but also for the broader market for 
mortgage securities.  In that month, Moody’s and S&P downgraded the ratings of hundreds of 
RMBS and CDO securities, including 40 Long Beach subprime securities.258
downgrades caused many investors to immediately stop buying subprime RMBS securities, and 
the securities plummeted in value.  Wall Street firms were increasingly unable to find investors 
for new subprime RMBS securitizations.

In August 2007, WaMu’s internal audit department released a lengthy audit report 

criticizing Long Beach’s poor loan origination and underwriting practices.259
time, Long Beach had been rebranded as WaMu’s Wholesale Specialty Lending division, 
the subprime market had collapsed, and subprime loans were no longer marketable.  The 
audit report nevertheless provided a detailed and negative review of its operations:

“[T]he overall system of risk management and internal controls has deficiencies related to

Issue – Underwriting guidelines established to mitigate the risk of unsound underwriting 
decisions are not always followed ….  Improvements in controls designed to ensure 
adherence to Exception Oversight Policy and Procedures is required ….  [A]ccurate 
reporting and tracking of exceptions to policy does not exist.”260
 

 

In response, Mr. Rotella wrote to WaMu’s General Auditor:  “This seems to me to be the 
ultimate in bayonetting the wounded, if not the dead.”261

   

  

 
Subprime Lending Ends.  In September 2007, with investors no longer interested in 
buying subprime loans or securitizations, WaMu shut down all of its subprime operations.262  
During the prior year, which was their peak, Long Beach and WaMu had securitized $29 billion 
in subprime loans; by 2007, due to the collapse of the subprime secondary market, WaMu’s 
volume for the year dropped to $5.5 billion.  Altogether, from 2000 to 2007, Long Beach and 
WaMu had securitized at least $77 billion in subprime loans.263

 
When asked about Long Beach at the Subcommittee’s hearing, all of the WaMu former 
managers who testified remembered its operations as being problematic, and could not explain 
why WaMu failed to strengthen its operations.  Mr. Vanasek, former Chief Risk Officer, testified 
that Long Beach did not have an effective risk management regime when he arrived at WaMu in 
1999, and that it had not developed an effective risk management regime by the time he retired at 
the end of 2005.264  Likewise, Mr. Cathcart, who replaced Mr. Vanasek as Chief Risk Officer, 
testified that Long Beach never developed effective risk management during the course of his 
tenure.265
 
At the April 13 Subcommittee hearing, Senator Levin asked Mr. Vanasek:  “Is it fair to 
say that WaMu is not particularly worried about the risk associated with Long Beach subprime 
mortgages because it sold those loans and passed the risk on to investors?”  Mr. Vanasek replied:  
“Yes, I would say that was a fair characterization.”266

 

 

 
Home Loans President David Schneider, who had direct responsibility for addressing the 
problems at Long Beach, testified that he tried to improve Long Beach, but “ultimately decided 
… Long Beach was an operation that we should shut down.”267
  WaMu President Steve Rotella 
also acknowledged the inability of WaMu management to resolve the problems at Long Beach:

“We did bring the volume in Long Beach down substantially every quarter starting in the 
first quarter of 2006.  As we went through that process, it became increasingly clear, as I 
have indicated in here, that the problems in Long Beach were deep and the only way we 
could address those were to continue to cut back volume and ultimately shut it down.”268

 

Community Impact.  Long Beach’s poor quality loans not only proved unprofitable for 

many investors, they were often devastating for the borrowers and their communities.  Mr. 
Killinger testified at the Subcommittee hearing that WaMu, “entered the subprime business with 
our purchase of Long Beach Mortgage in 1999 to better serve an underserved market.”269
  But 
the unfortunate result of many Long Beach loans was that they left communities reeling from 
widespread foreclosures and lost homes.   

  Those ten areas were, in order:  Detroit, Cleveland, Stockton, Sacramento, 

 
In November 2008, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) which oversees 
all nationally chartered banks, identified the ten metropolitan areas across the United States with 
the highest rates of foreclosure for subprime and Alt A mortgages originated from 2005 through 
2007.270
Riverside/San Bernardino, Memphis, Miami/Fort Lauderdale, Bakersfield, Denver, and Las 
Vegas.  The OCC then identified the lenders with the highest foreclosure rates in each of those 
devastated cities.  Long Beach had the worst foreclosure rate in four of those areas, and was near 
the worst in five more, with the lone exception being Las Vegas.  The OCC data also showed 
that, overall in the ten metropolitan areas, Long Beach mortgages had the second worst 
foreclosure rate of all the lenders reviewed, with over 11,700 foreclosures at the time of the 
report.  Only New Century was worse.  

 
 (2)  WaMu Retail Lending 

 

 

 

Washington Mutual’s problems were not confined to its subprime operations; they also 
affected its retail operations.  WaMu loosened underwriting standards as part of its High Risk 
Lending Strategy, and received repeated criticisms from its regulators, as outlined in the next 
chapter, for weak underwriting standards, risk layering, excessive loan error and exception rates, 
appraisal problems, and loan fraud.  In August 2007, more than a year before the collapse of the 
bank, WaMu’s President Steve Rotella emailed CEO Kerry Killinger saying that, aside from 
Long Beach, WaMu’s prime home loan business “was the worst managed business I had seen in 
my career.”271

   

 
(a)  Inadequate Systems and Weak Oversight 
 
One reason for WaMu’s poor lending practices was its failure to adequately monitor the 

hundreds of billions of dollars of residential loans being issued each year by its own loan

personnel.  From 1990 until 2002, WaMu acquired more than 20 new banks and mortgage 
companies, including American Savings Bank, Great Western Bank, Fleet Mortgage 
Corporation, Dime Bancorp, PNC Mortgage, and Long Beach.  WaMu struggled to integrate 
dozens of lending platforms, information technology systems, staffs, and policies, whose 
inconsistencies and gaps exposed the bank to loan errors and fraud. 

 
To address the problem, WaMu invested millions of dollars in a technology program 

called Optis, which WaMu President Rotella described in the end as “a complete failure” that the 
bank “had to write off” and abandon.272
  In 2004, an OTS Report of Examination (ROE), which 
was given to the bank’s Board of Directors, included this observation: 

 
“Our review disclosed that past rapid growth through acquisition and unprecedented 
mortgage refinance activity placed significant operational strain on [Washington Mutual] 
during the early part of the review period.  Beginning in the second half of 2003, market 
conditions deteriorated, and the failure of [Washington Mutual] to fully integrate past 
mortgage banking acquisitions, address operational issues, and realize expectations from 
certain major IT initiatives exposed the institution’s infrastructure weaknesses and began 
to negatively impact operating results.”273

 

The records reviewed by the Subcommittee showed that, from 2004 until its shuttering in 2008, 
WaMu constantly struggled with information technology issues that limited its ability to monitor 
loan errors, exception rates, and indicators of loan fraud. 
 

From 2004 to 2008, WaMu’s regulators also repeatedly criticized WaMu’s failure to 

exercise sufficient oversight of its loan personnel to reduce excessive loan error and exception 
rates that allowed the issuance of loans in violation of WaMu’s credit standards.274
Craig Chapman, then the President of WaMu Home Loans, visited a number of the bank’s loan 
centers around the country.  Lawrence Carter, then OTS Examiner-in-Charge at WaMu, spoke 
with Mr. Chapman about what he found.  Recalling that conversation in a later email, Mr. Carter 
wrote: 

  In 2004, 

 
“Craig has been going around the country visiting home lending and fulfillment offices. 
His view is that band-aids have been used to address past issues and that there is a 
fundamental absence of process.”275
 
The regulators’ examination reports on WaMu indicate that its oversight efforts remained 

 

weak.  In February 2005, OTS stated that WaMu’s loan underwriting “has been an area of

concern for several exams.”276  In June 2005, OTS expressed concern about the bank’s 
underwriting exceptions and policy compliance.277  In August of the same year, the OTS Report 
of Examination stated that, “the level of deficiencies, if left unchecked, could erode the credit 
quality of the portfolio,” and specifically drew attention to WaMu concentrations in higher risk 
loans that were a direct result of its High Risk Lending Strategy.278  2006 was no better.  OTS 
repeatedly criticized the level of underwriting exceptions and errors.279

 
Another problem was the weak role played by WaMu’s compliance department.  In 
March 2007, an OTS examiner noted that WaMu had just hired its “ninth compliance leader 
since 2000,” and that its “compliance management program has suffered from a lack of steady, 
consistent leadership.”  The examiner added:  “The Board of Directors should commission an 
evaluation of why smart, successful, effective managers can’t succeed in this position.  …  
(HINT: It has to do with top management not buying into the importance of compliance and turf 
warfare and Kerry [Killinger] not liking bad news.)”280
 
  
Still another problem was that WaMu failed to devote sufficient resources to overseeing 
the many loans it acquired from third party lenders and mortgage brokers.  The 2010 Treasury 
and FDIC IG report found that, from 2003 to 2007, a substantial portion of WaMu’s residential 
loans – from 48% to 70% – came from third party lenders and brokers.281
found: 
 

  The IG report also 

   

“The financial incentive to use wholesale loan channels for production was significant.  
According to an April 2006 internal presentation to the WaMu Board, it cost WaMu 
about 66 percent less to close a wholesale loan ($1,809 per loan) than it did to close a 
retail loan ($5,273).  Thus, WaMu was able to reduce its cost of operations through the 
use of third-party originators but had far less oversight over the quality of 
originations.”282

 

 

During its last five years, WaMu accepted loans from tens of thousands of third party 

brokers and lenders across the country, not only through its wholesale and correspondent 
channels, but also through its securitization conduits that bought Alt A and subprime loans in 
bulk.  Evidence gathered by the Subcommittee from OTS examination reports, WaMu internal

documents, and oral testimony shows that WaMu exercised weak oversight over the thousands of 
brokers submitting loans.  For example, a 2003 OTS report concluded that WaMu’s “annual 
review and monitoring process for wholesale mortgage brokers was inadequate, as management 
did not consider key performance indicators such as delinquency rates and fraud incidents.”283  A 
2003 WaMu quality assurance review found an “error rate of 29 percent for wholesale mortgage 
loans, more than triple the acceptable error rate of 8 percent established by WaMu.”284  A 2004 
OTS examination noted that 20,000 brokers and lenders had submitted loans to WaMu for 
approval during the year, a volume that was “challenging to manage.”285 A 2005 internal WaMu 
investigation of two high volume loan centers in Southern California that accepted loans from 
brokers found that “78% of the funded retail broker loans reviewed were found to contain 
fraud.”286  A 2006 internal WaMu inquiry into why loans purchased through its subprime 
conduit were experiencing high delinquency rates found the bank had securitized broker loans 
that were delinquent, not underwritten to standards, and suffering from “lower credit quality.”287

 

 
OTS examinations in 2006 and 2007 also identified deficiencies in WaMu’s oversight 

efforts.288  For example, a 2007 OTS memorandum found that, in 2007, Washington Mutual had 
only 14 full-time employees overseeing more than 34,000 third party brokers submitting loans to 
the bank for approval,289
 which meant that each WaMu employee oversaw more than 2,400 
brokers.  The OTS examination not only questioned the staffing level, but also criticized the 
scorecard WaMu used to rate the mortgage brokers, which did not include the rates at which 
significant lending or documentation deficiencies were attributed to the broker, the rate at which 
the broker’s loans were denied or produced unsaleable loans, or any indication of whether the 
broker was included on industry watch lists for prior or suspected misconduct.   

 
In 2006, federal regulators issued Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage 
Product Risks (NTM Guidance) providing standards on how banks “can offer nontraditional 
mortgage products in a safe and sound manner.”290
  It focused, in part, on the need for banks to 
“have strong systems and controls in place for establishing and maintaining relationships” with 
third party lenders and brokers submitting high risk loans for approval.  It instructed banks to 
monitor the quality of the submitted loans to detect problems such as “early payment defaults, 
incomplete documentation, and fraud.”  If problems arose, the NTM Guidance directed banks to 
“take immediate action”:

“Oversight of third party brokers and correspondents who originate nontraditional 
mortgage loans should involve monitoring the quality of originations so that they reflect 
the institution’s lending standards and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
… If appraisal, loan documentation, credit problems or consumer complaints are 
discovered, the institution should take immediate action.”291
 
WaMu did, at times, exercise oversight of its third party brokers.  A 2006 credit review of 
its subprime loans, for example, showed that Long Beach – which by then reported to the WaMu 
Home Loans Division – had terminated relationships with ten brokers in 2006, primarily because 
their loans had experienced high rates of first payment defaults requiring Long Beach to 
repurchase them at significant expense.292  But terminating those ten brokers was not enough to 
cure the many problems with the third party loans WaMu acquired.  The report also noted that, in 
2006, apparently for the first time, Long Beach had introduced “collateral and broker risk” into 
its underwriting process.293

  

  

 
WaMu closed down its wholesale and subprime channels in 2007, and its Alt A and 

subprime securitization conduits in 2008. 

 
(b)  Risk Layering 
 
During the five-year period reviewed by the Subcommittee, from 2004 to 2008, WaMu 

issued many loans with multiple higher risk features, a practice known as “risk layering.”  At the 
April 13 Subcommittee hearing, Mr. Vanasek, its Chief Risk Officer from 2004 to 2005, testified 
about the dangers of this practice: 

90 

 

“It was the layering of risk brought about by these incremental changes that so altered the 
underlying credit quality of mortgage lending which became painfully evident once 
housing prices peaked and began to decline.  Some may characterize the events that took 
place as a ‘perfect storm,’ but I would describe it as an inevitable consequence of 
consistently adding risk to the portfolio in a period of inflated housing price 
appreciation.”294
 
Stated Income Loans.  One common risk layering practice at WaMu was to allow 

 

borrowers to “state” the amount of their annual income in their loan applications without any 
direct documentation or verification by the bank.   Data compiled by the Treasury and the FDIC 
IG report showed that, by the end of 2007, 50% of WaMu’s subprime loans, 73% of its Option 
ARMs, and 90% of its home equity loans were stated income loans.295
  The bank’s acceptance of 
unverified income information came on top of its use of loans with other high risk features, such

as borrowers with low credit scores or the use of low initial teaser interest rates followed by 
much higher rates.   

 
Stated income loans were originally developed to assist self employed individuals that 
had good credit and high net worth to obtain loans they could afford.  But from 2004 to 2008, 
stated income loans became much more widespread, including with respect to a wide variety of 
high risk loans.296

  Mr. Cathcart testified at the Subcommittee hearing: 

 
“[Stated income loans] originated as a product for self-employed individuals who didn’t 
have pay stubs and whose financial statements didn’t necessarily reflect what they made.  
It was intended to be available for only the most creditworthy borrowers and it was 
supposed to be tested for reasonableness so that a person who said that they were a waiter 
or a lower-paid individual couldn’t say that they had an income of $100,000. 

“I think that the standards eroded over time.  At least I have become aware, reading all 
that has happened … standards eroded over time and that it became a competitive tool 
that was used by banks to gather business, so that if a loan consultant could send his loan 
to Bank A or Bank B, the consultant would say, well, why don’t you go to Bank B?  You 
don’t have to state your income. 

 

 

“I do think, thinking it through, that there was a certain amount of coaxing that was 
possible between the loan consultant and the individual, which would be something 
which would be invisible to a bank that received the application and the only test for that 
would be reasonableness, which as you have heard there were some issues within the 
portfolio.”297
 
WaMu required its loan personnel to determine whether a loan applicant’s stated income 
was reasonable, but evidence obtained by the Subcommittee indicates that requirement was not 
effectively implemented.  A 2008 press report about a WaMu stated income loan is illustrative: 

 

 
“As a supervisor at a Washington Mutual mortgage processing center, John D. Parsons 
was accustomed to seeing baby sitters claiming salaries worthy of college presidents, and 
schoolteachers with incomes rivaling stockbrokers.  He rarely questioned them.  A real 
estate frenzy was under way and WaMu, as his bank was known, was all about saying 
yes. 
 
“Yet even by WaMu’s relaxed standards, one mortgage four years ago raised eyebrows.  
The borrower was claiming a six-figure income and an unusual profession:  mariachi 
singer. 

                                                 
296 See, e.g., NTM Guidance at 58614 (“Institutions increasingly rely on reduced documentation, particularly 
unverified income, to qualify borrowers for nontraditional mortgage loans.”).  The NTM Guidance directed banks to 
use stated income loans “with caution,” but did not prohibit them or even issue guidance limiting their use.  Id. at 
58611.  
297 April 13, 2010 Subcommittee Hearing at 41. 

 

 

92 

“Mr. Parsons could not verify the singer’s income, so he had him photographed in front 
of his home dressed in his mariachi outfit.  The photo went into a WaMu file.  
Approved.”298

 

Instead of verifying borrower income, WaMu loan personnel apparently focused instead 

on borrower credit scores, as a proxy measure of a borrower’s creditworthiness.  The problem 
with this approach, however, was that a person could have a high credit score – reflecting the 
fact that they paid their bills on time – and still have an income that was insufficient to support 
the mortgage amount being requested. 

 
High LTV Ratios.  A second risk-layering practice at WaMu involved loan-to-value 
(LTV) ratios.  LTV ratios are a critical risk management tool, because they compare the loan 
amount to the estimated dollar value of the property.  If an LTV ratio is too high and the 
borrower defaults, the sale of the property may not produce sufficient proceeds to pay off the 
loan.  In interagency guidance, federal banking regulators noted that banks should generally 
avoid issuing loans with LTV ratios over 80%, and directed banks to ensure that loans with LTV 
ratios of 90% or more have additional credit support such as mortgage insurance or added 
collateral.299  The Treasury and the FDIC IG report found that WaMu held a “significant 
percentage” of home loans in which the LTV ratios exceeded 80%.300
 

   

These loans were the result of explicit WaMu policies allowing high LTV ratios to be 

used in loans that already had other high risk features.  In February 2005, for example, WaMu set 
up automated loan approval parameters to approve loans with a 90% LTV in Option ARM and 
interest-only loans providing financing of up to $1 million.301
added to these loans by permitting the borrowers to have credit scores as low as 620.   

  Still another layer of risk was 

 
The Treasury and the FDIC IG report determined that 44% of WaMu’s subprime loans 
and 35% of its home equity loans had LTV ratios in excess of 80%.302
  These loans resulted in 
part from a 2006 WaMu decision to combine home equity loans bearing high LTV ratios with 
borrowers bearing low credit scores.  That initiative was discussed in a June 2006 email sent to 
Mr. Rotella, after he inquired about the project.  He was informed: 

 

                                                 
298 “Saying Yes, WaMu Built Empire on Shaky Loans,” New York Times (12/27/08).  When asked about this press 
report, WaMu told the Subcommittee that it had no record of this loan, but could not deny that the incident took 
place as reported.  See also, in the following subsection, a WaMu loan issued to a “Sign Designer” who claimed 
earnings of $34,000 per month.

mortgage insurance or government guarantees with LTV ratios in excess of 80%, and $15 billion in home equity 
loans and lines of credit with LTV ratios in excess of 80%).

“$4 billion home equity investment program [was] approved … last Friday.  High CLTVs 
[Combined Loan-to-Value ratios] (up to 100%) and lower FICOs (down to 600) 
permitted with some concentration limits.”303
 

 

In order to issue these loans as soon as possible in 2006, WaMu set up an underwriting team to 
provide “manual” approvals outside of its automated systems:   

 
“Our team is currently focused on several HE [Home Equity] modeling initiatives to 
include higher risk lending ….  [W]e are adjusting our decision engine rules for a July 
roll out to allow for 580-620 [FICO scores] and LT 80% CLTV [combined loan-to-value] 
loans to be referred to a manual ‘sub-prime’ underwriting team that we are putting in 
place.  … [W]e see this 580-620 segment as the biggest opportunity where we aren’t 
lending today.”304
 
Also in 2006, WaMu began issuing so-called “80/20 loans,” in which a package of two 
loans are issued together, imposing an 80% LTV first lien and a 20% LTV second lien on the 
property, for a total combined LTV (CLTV) of 100%.305  Loans that provide financing for 100% 
of a property’s value are extremely high risk, because the borrower has no equity in the property, 
the borrower can stop payments on the loan without losing a personal investment, and a 
subsequent home sale may not produce sufficient funds to pay off the debt.306  Yet in 2006, 
Home Loans Division President David Schneider approved issuing 80/20 loans despite the risk 
and despite the fact that WaMu’s automatic underwriting system was not equipped to accept 
them, and loan officers initially had to use a manual system to issue the loans.307

 

 

 
Using Low Interest Rates to Qualify Borrowers.  A third risk layering practice at 

WaMu was allowing loan officers to qualify prospective borrowers for short term hybrid ARMs 
or Option ARMs based upon only the initial low rate and not the higher interest rate that would 
take effect later on.  In a filing with the SEC, for example, Washington Mutual Inc. wrote that its 
“underwriting guidelines” allowed “borrowers with hybrid adjustable-rate home loans … where 
the initial interest rate is fixed for 2 to 5 years” to be “qualified at the payment associated with 
the fixed interest rate charged in the initial contractual period.”308
  In addition, in 2005, WaMu 
personnel informed OTS that, since 2004, the bank had not been qualifying its Option ARM

borrowers using the “fully indexed rate.”309  Instead, WaMu was using a lower “administrative” 
rate that was “significantly less than the fully indexed rate.”310

   

 
Borrowers, loan officers, and WaMu executives often assumed that hybrid and Option 

ARMs could be refinanced before the payments reset to higher levels – an expectation that 
eventually proved to be unfounded.  In a November 30, 2007 email discussing loan 
modifications from Mr. Schneider to Mr. Killinger, Mr. Rotella and other senior executives, Mr. 
Schneider described WaMu’s faulty assumptions about the “start rate” and life span of these 
loans: 

 
“I also think it is clear that the economic benefit of providing modifications for these 
borrowers is compelling for the following reasons: 

- None of these borrowers ever expected that they would have to pay at a rate 
greater than the start rate.  In fact, for the most part they were qualified at the start 
rate 
- We need to provide incentive to these borrowers to maintain the home – 
especially if the home value has declined 
- When we booked these loans, we anticipated an average life of 2 years and 
never really anticipated the rate adjustments ….”311

 

 
Qualifying borrowers using the lower initial interest rate enabled banks to qualify more 
borrowers for those loans and enabled them to issue loans for larger amounts.  Concerned that 
more banks were beginning to use this risky practice, federal banking regulators addressed it in 
the October 2006 NTM Guidance, which cautioned banks to use the fully indexed rate when 
qualifying borrowers for a loan, including loans with lower initial teaser rates.312  In addition, the 
Guidance provided that for negatively amortizing loans, banks should consider not only the 
“initial loan amount” but also “any balance increase that may accrue from the negative 
amortization provision.”313
that applying the new requirement to all of its loans would cause a 33% drop in its loan volume 
due to borrowers who would no longer qualify for its loans: 

  After the NTM Guidance was issued, a WaMu analyst calculated 

 
“Implementing the NTM change for Purchase only drops additional 2.5% of volume  …  
If we implement the NTM changes to all loans, then we’ll see additional drop of 33% of 
volume.”314

In response to this information, WaMu’s chief risk officer wrote that the impact on the bank 
“argues in favor of holding off on implementation until required to act for public relations … or 
regulatory reasons.” 
 
 
NTM Guidance, WaMu continued qualifying high risk borrowers using the lower interest rate, 
originating billions of dollars in new loans that would later suffer significant losses. 

 
Because OTS gave the bank more than six months to come into compliance with the 

 
WaMu’s risk-layering practices went beyond its use of stated income loans, high LTV 

 
ratios, and the qualification of borrowers using low initial interest rates.  The bank also allowed 
its loan officers to issue large volumes of high risk loans to borrowers who did not occupy the 
homes they were purchasing or had large debt-to-income ratios.315
concentrated its loans in a small number of states, especially California and Florida, increasing 
the risk that a downturn in those states would have a disproportionate impact upon the 
delinquency rates of its already high risk loans.   

  On top of those risks, WaMu 

 
At one point in 2004, Mr. Vanasek made a direct appeal to WaMu CEO Killinger, urging 

him to scale back the high risk lending practices that were beginning to dominate not only 
WaMu, but the U.S. mortgage market as a whole.  Despite his efforts, he received no response:  

 

 

“As the market deteriorated, in 2004, I went to the Chairman and CEO with a proposal 
and a very strong personal appeal to publish a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal 
disavowing many of the then-current industry underwriting practices, such as 100 percent 
loan-to-value subprime loans, and thereby adopt what I termed responsible lending 
practices.  I acknowledged that in so doing the company would give up a degree of 
market share and lose some of the originators to the competition, but I believed that 
Washington Mutual needed to take an industry-leading position against deteriorating 
underwriting standards and products that were not in the best interests of the industry, the 
bank, or the consumers.  There was, unfortunately, never any further discussion or 
response to the recommendation.”316
 
(c)  Loan Fraud 
 
Perhaps the clearest evidence of WaMu’s shoddy lending practices came when senior 

    

  

 

management was informed of loans containing fraudulent information, but then did little to stop 
the fraud.

Downey and Montebello Fraud Investigations.  The most significant example involves 

an internal WaMu investigation that, in 2005, uncovered substantial evidence of loan fraud 
involving two top producing loan offices in Southern California.  WaMu management was 
presented with the findings, but failed to respond, leading to the same fraud allegations erupting 
again in 2007.  According to the WaMu Home Loans Credit Risk Mitigation Team that 
conducted the 2005 internal investigation, it was initiated in response to “a sustained history of 
confirmed fraud findings over the past three years” involving the two offices, known as Downey 
and Montebello.317
  Each office was located in a low-income area of Los Angeles and headed by 
a loan officer who had won repeated WaMu awards for high volume loan production.   

 
To conduct its inquiry, the WaMu Risk Mitigation Team reviewed all of the loans 

  A November 2005 memorandum summarizing the review stated that it 

produced by the two offices over a two-month period from August to September 2005, which 
totaled 751 loans.  Analysts scored the loans using a standard electronic fraud detection program, 
and then reviewed all of the loans flagged for possible fraud, as well as ten percent of the 
remaining loans.318
found an “extensive level of loan fraud” caused primarily by employees “circumventing” bank 
policies:  
 
“[A]n extensive level of loan fraud exists in the Emerging Markets [loan processing 
centers], virtually all of it stemming from employees in these areas circumventing bank 
policy surrounding loan verification and review.  Of the 129 detailed loan review[s] … 
conducted to date, 42% of the loans reviewed contained suspect activity or fraud, 
virtually all of it attributable to some sort of employee malfeasance or failure to execute 
company policy.  In terms of employee activity enabling this perpetration of fraud, the 
following categories of activity appeared most frequently:  inconsistent application of 
credit policy, errors or negligence, process design flaws, intentional circumvention of 
established processes, and overriding automated decisioning recommendations.  …  
Based on the consistent and pervasive pattern of activity among these employees, we are 
recommending firm action be taken to address these particular willful behaviors on the 
part of the employees named.”319
 
A presentation prepared for WaMu management provided additional detail.320  It stated 

 
that, out of the 751 loans produced, the Risk Mitigation Team had selected 180 loans for detailed 
review, of which 129 had been completed.321  It stated that 42% of the reviewed loans had 
“contained excessive levels of fraud related to loan qualifying data.”322
  It also stated that the 
fraud findings did not differ between loans originated by WaMu’s own loan officers and loans

qualifying information were confirmed in every aspect of this file, including: – Income –

borrower[.]  The credit package was found to be completely fabricated.  Throughout the 
process, red flags were over-looked, process requirements were waived, and exceptions 
to policy were granted.”325
 
The presentation noted that the loan delinquency rate for Luis Fragoso, the loan officer 

 

heading the Montebello loan office, was “289% worse than the delinquency performance for the 
entire open/active retail channel book of business,” while the delinquency rate for Thomas 
Ramirez, the loan officer heading the Downey loan office was 157% worse.326
from the Risk Mitigation Team was clear that the two head loan officers were willfully flouting 
bank policy, issuing poor quality loans, and needed to be the subject of “firm action” by the 
bank. 

  The message 

 
Three months prior to its formal presentation on the fraud, the Risk Mitigation Team 

supplied a lengthy email with its fraud findings to colleagues in the credit risk department.  The 
August 2005 email provided spreadsheets containing data collected on the loans from the two 
offices as well as figures about the types of loans reviewed and fraud found.327
  Among other 
information, it indicated that at the Downey office, 83 loans had been reviewed, including 28 
originated by the WaMu loan officer Thomas Ramirez, and 54 submitted to him by third party 
brokers; while at the Montebello office, 48 loans had been reviewed, including 19 originated by 
the WaMu loan officer Luis Fragoso and 29 submitted to him by third party brokers.  The email 
was forwarded by a credit risk officer to WaMu’s Chief Risk Officer Jim Vanasek, with the 
following comment:   

 
“As you requested in our Enterprise Fraud Committee meeting last Friday, the attached 
email contains a high-level summary of the investigations the Home Loans Risk Mit team 
has conducted on [the two offices] over the past year and a half, based on loans that were

analysis] will allow us to substantially validate what we suspect, which is that the 
incidence of fraud in this area is greater than with other producers.”328
 

  

At the Subcommittee hearing, Mr. Vanasek agreed these were “eye popping” rates of fraud.329

 

  She asked 

 
 
On November 18, 2005, Cheryl Feltgen, the Home Loans Chief Credit Officer, “had a 
very quick meeting” with Home Loans President David Schneider, the head of Home Loans 
sales, Tony Meola, and others in which she reviewed the memorandum and presentation on the 
fraud investigation.330  After the meeting, she sent an email to the Risk Mitigation Team stating:  
“The good news is that people are taking this very seriously.  They requested some additional 
information that will aid in making some decisions on the right course of action.”331
the Risk Mitigation Team to prepare a new spreadsheet with the loan information, which the 
team did over the weekend in anticipation of a Monday meeting. 
 
 
The trail of documentation in 2005 about the fraud investigation ends there.  Despite the 
year-long effort put into the investigation, the written materials prepared, the meetings held, and 
fraud rates in excess of 58% and 83% at the Downey and Montebello offices, no discernable 
actions were taken by WaMu management to address the fraud problem in those two offices.  No 
one was fired or disciplined for routinely violating bank policy, no anti-fraud program was 
installed, no notice of the problem was sent to the bank’s regulators, and no investors who 
purchased RMBS securities containing loans from those offices were alerted to the fraud 
problem underlying their high delinquency rates.  Mr. Vanasek retired from the bank in 
December 2005, and the new Chief Risk Officer Ron Cathcart was never told about the fraud 
investigation.  Senior personnel, including Mr. Schneider, Mr. Meola, and Ms. Feltgen, failed to 
follow up on the matter. 
 
 
Ramirez and Fragoso, continued to issue high volumes of loans332 and continued to win awards

no one responded to its concerns, in September 2007, AIG filed a Suspected Fraud Claim with 
the California Department of Insurance which, in turn, notified OTS of the problem.335  The OTS 
Examiner-in-Charge at WaMu at the time, Benjamin Franklin, asked the bank to conduct an

uncovered the 2005 investigation that had identified the problem two years earlier, but was 
ignored by management.  The 2008 memorandum stated: 

Seven months later, in April 2008, CFI and the Audit department issued a 12-page 

  The memorandum not only confirmed the presence of fraud 

 
“In 2005, HL [Home Loans] Risk Mitigation provided Senior HL Management with an 
assessment of fraud and loan performance in the Retail Broker Program and two 
Southern California Emerging Markets [loan centers] for the period of September 2003 
through August 2005.  This assessment identified excessive levels of fraud related to loan 
qualifying data ….  It also highlighted the Downey and Montebello [loan centers] as the 
primary contributors of these fraudulent loan documents based upon volume and 
articulated strategies to mitigate fraud.  The report also stated that delinquency 
performance on these [loan centers] … were significantly worse that the delinquency 
performance for the entire open/active retail channel book of business.  In 2007, HL Risk 
Mitigation mirrored their 2005 review with a smaller sample of loans and found that, for 
the September and October 2007 sampled time period, the volume of misrepresentation 
and suspected loan fraud continued to be high for this [loan center] (62% of the sampled 
loans).”338

 

 

 
Examples of fraudulent loan information uncovered in the 2007 review included falsified income 
documents, unreasonable income for the stated profession, false residency claims, inflated 
appraisal values, failure of the loan to meet bank guidelines, suspect social security numbers, 
misrepresented assets, and falsified credit information.339

to “monitor the situation.”341  But no one knew “of additional monitoring that was done, or 
efforts to bring additional attention to” the fraudulent loans from the Downey and Montebello 
offices.  The memorandum also noted that no personnel action had been taken against either of 
the loan officers heading the two offices.342  David Schneider was interviewed and “recalled 
little about the 2005 fraud findings or actions taken to address them.”343
was handled or resolved.”  The WaMu memorandum concluded: 

  He “thought the matter 

 
“Outside of training sessions … in late 2005, there was little evidence that any of the 
recommended strategies were followed or that recommendations were operationalized.  
There were no targeted reviews conducted … on the Downey or Montebello loan 
portfolios between 2005 and the actions taken in December 2007.”344
 
After the memorandum was issued, WaMu initially resisted providing a copy to OTS, 

 
claiming it was protected by attorney-client privilege.345
Benjamin Franklin told the Subcommittee that he insisted on seeing the memorandum.  After 
finally receiving it and reading about the substantial loan fraud occurring at the two loan offices 
since 2005, he told the Subcommittee that it was “the last straw” that ended his confidence that 
he could rely on WaMu to combat fraudulent practices within its own ranks. 

  The OTS Examiner-in-Charge 

   

 
The 2008 WaMu memorandum and a subsequent OTS examination memorandum346 

included a number of recommendations to address the fraud problem at the Downey and 
Montebello offices.  The recommendations in the WaMu memorandum included actions to 
“[d]etermine appropriate disciplinary actions for employees”; “[e]nhance Code of Conduct 
training to stress each employee’s role as a corporate steward and the consequences for passively 
facilitating the placement of loans into the origination process that could be suspect”; enhance 
WaMu compensation incentives “to support loan quality”; and determine if further analysis was 
required of the loans originated by the Montebello office or “the broader loan population (bank 
owned and securitized)” including “if actions are needed to address put backs or sales to 
investors of loans that contain misrepresentation[s] or other fraud findings.”347

 
By the time WaMu issued the April 2008 memorandum on the Downey and Montebello 
fraud problem, however, the bank was already experiencing serious liquidity problems and was 
cutting back on its loan operations and personnel.  On April 30, 2008, WaMu put an end to its 
wholesale loan channel which had accepted loans from third party mortgage brokers, closed 186

stand-alone loan centers, and reduced its workforce by 3,000.348
  The Downey and Montebello 
offices were closed as part of that larger effort.  The two loan officers heading those offices left 
the bank and found other jobs in the mortgage industry that involve making loans to borrowers.   

 
Other Fraud Problems.  The loan fraud problems at the Downey and Montebello offices 

were not the only fraud problems plaguing WaMu.  The Subcommittee uncovered three 
additional examples that demonstrate the problem was not isolated. 

 
The first example involves the Westlake Village loan office outside of Los Angeles.  On 
April 1, 2008, WaMu’s Risk Mitigation Team sent 13 home loans with early payment defaults to 
the WaMu Corporate Fraud Investigations (CFI) group for further examination.349  All 13, whose 
unpaid loan balances totaled about $14.3 million, had been issued in 2007, by the Westlake 
Village loan office which was one of WaMu’s top loan producers.  Two loan officers, Chris 
O’Brien and Brian Minkow, who worked in tandem, had won multiple awards for their loan 
production and had a team of 14 sales associates assisting them.350  CFI reviewed the referred 
loans which contained a variety of fraud indicators, including “fabricated asset statements, 
altered statements, income misrepresentation and one altered statement that is believed to have 
been used in two separate loans.”351
personnel at the WaMu “loan fulfillment center” (LFC) that processed Westlake Village loan 
applications. 

  CFI then interviewed the loan officers, sales associates, and 

 
In one egregious example of document “manufacturing,” a sales associate confessed that 
if “it was too late to call the borrower,” the “sales associates would take [bank] statements from 
other [loan] files and cut and paste the current borrower’s name and address” onto the old bank 
statements.352  The same sales associate “admitted that during that crunch time some of the 
Associates would ‘manufacture’ asset statements from previous loan docs,” because end-of-
month loans would often get funded without full documentation.  The pressure to get the 
necessary documentation was “tremendous” and they had been told to get the loans funded “with 
whatever it took.”353

 
The LFC loan processor in charge of handling Westlake Village’s loan applications was 
fired, as was the sales associate who confessed to manufacturing false documents.  The rest of 
the employees were also let go, when the office itself was closed on April 30, 2008, in

the office told the Subcommittee, however, that he had been offered another job within the bank, 
but declined it due to lower compensation.354
arranging residential loans. 

  He went on to work in the mortgage industry 

 
 The second example involves 25 Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) totaling $8.5 

million that were originated in 2008 by a WaMu loan officer at the Sunnyvale loan office in 
California.  Before all of the loans were funded, they were referred to the Risk Mitigation Team 
because of fraud indicators.  On May 1, 2008, the loan files were sent on to the CFI group for 
further inquiry.  An internal document summarizing the CFI investigation stated:    

 
“The review found that the borrowers indicated they owned the property free and clear 
when in fact existing liens were noted on the properties.  The properties are located in 
California, Arizona and Washington.  …  WaMu used … Abbreviated Title reports [that] 
… do not provide existing lien information on the subject property.”355
 

 

 

  

Of the 25 loan applications, 22 were ultimately terminated or declined.  The employee involved 
in originating the loans was terminated as part of the April 30, 2008 reorganization. 

 
The third example involves a review of 2006 and 2007 WaMu loans conducted by Radian 

      

Guaranty Inc., a company which provided mortgage insurance for those loans.356  Radian’s 
objectives were to test WaMu’s “compliance with Radian’s underwriting guidelines and eligible 
loan criteria,” assess the quality of WaMu’s underwriting decisions, “rate the risk of the 
individual loans insured,” and identify any errors in the loan data transmitted to Radian.357  The 
review looked at a random selection of 133 loans and found enough problems to give WaMu an 
overall rating of “unacceptable.”358

   

 
The Radian review identified a number of problems in the loan files it deemed ineligible 

for insurance.  In one, WaMu issued a $484,500 loan to a “Sign Designer” who claimed to be 
making $34,000 in income every month.359
  The Radian review observed:  “Borrower’s stated 
monthly income of $34,000 does not appear reasonable for a ‘Sign Designer.’”  The review also 
noted several high risk elements in the loan, which was an 85% LTV loan given to a borrower 
with a 689 credit score who used the loan to refinance an existing loan and “cash-out” the equity 
in the house.   The review noted that the borrower received $203,000 at the loan closing.  In 
addition, the review stated that WaMu had appraised the house at $575,000, but an automated 
appraisal verification program assigned the house a probable value of only $321,000, less than 
the amount of the loan.

Extent of Fraud.  At the Subcommittee hearing, when asked about these matters, Mr. 

Vanasek, WaMu’s Chief Risk Officer from 2004 to 2005, attributed the loan fraud to 
compensation incentives that rewarded loan personnel and mortgage brokers according to the 
volume of loans they processed rather than the quality of the loans they produced: 

 
“Because of the compensation systems rewarding volume versus quality and the 
independent structure of the originators, I am confident at times borrowers were coached 
to fill out applications with overstated incomes or net worth to meet the minimum 
underwriting requirements.  Catching this kind of fraud was difficult at best and required 
the support of line management.  Not surprisingly, loan originators constantly threatened 
to quit and to go to Countrywide or elsewhere if the loan applications were not 
approved.”360
 

 

 

 

When asked by Senator Coburn if he thought the type of fraud at the Downey and Montebello 
loan offices extended beyond those two offices, Mr. Vanasek replied:  “Yes, Senator.”361
 
 
the bank’s failure, found that loans marked as containing fraudulent information had nevertheless 
been securitized and sold to investors.  The report blamed ineffective controls that had “existed 
for some time”: 

Another sobering internal WaMu report, issued in September 2008, a few weeks before 

 

 
“The controls that are intended to prevent the sale of loans that have been confirmed by 
Risk Mitigation to contain misrepresentations or fraud are not currently effective.  There 
is not a systematic process to prevent a loan in the Risk Mitigation Inventory and/or 
confirmed to contain suspicious activity from being sold to an investor.  ...   Of the 25 
loans tested, 11 reflected a sale date after the completion of the investigation which 
confirmed fraud.  There is evidence that this control weakness has existed for some 
time.”362

  

Loans not meeting the bank’s credit standards, deliberate risk layering, sales associates 

manufacturing documents, offices issuing loans in which 58%, 62%, or 83% contained evidence 
of loan fraud, and selling fraudulent loans to investors are evidence of deep seated problems that 
existed within WaMu’s lending practices.  Equally disturbing is evidence that when WaMu 
senior managers were confronted with evidence of substantial loan fraud, they failed to take 
corrective action.  WaMu’s failure to strengthen its lending practices, even when problems were 
identified, is emblematic of how lenders and mortgage brokers produced billions of dollars in 
high risk, poor quality home loans that contributed to the financial crisis.

(d) Steering Borrowers to High Risk Option ARMs 

104 

 

 

 

In addition to subprime loans, Washington Mutual made a variety of high risk loans to 

“prime” borrowers, including its flagship product, the Option Adjustable Rate Mortgage (Option 
ARM).  Washington Mutual’s Option ARMs typically offered borrowers an initial teaser rate, 
sometimes as low as 1% for the first month, which later adjusted to a much higher floating 
interest rate linked to an index, but gave borrowers the choice each month of paying a higher or 
lower amount.  These loans were called “Option” ARMs, because borrowers were typically 
given four options:  (1) paying the fully amortizing amount needed to pay off the loan in 30 
years; (2) paying an even higher amount to pay off the loan in 15 years; (3) paying only the 
interest owed that month and no principal; or (4) making a “minimum payment” that covered 
only a portion of the interest owed and none of the principal.363
  If the borrower selected the 
minimum payment option, unpaid interest would be added to the loan principal.  If the borrower 
repeatedly selected the minimum payment, the loan principal would increase rather than decrease 
over time, creating a negatively amortizing loan. 

 
Negative amortization created additional credit risk for WaMu and posed a challenge to 

risk managers.  At the April 13 Subcommittee hearing, Mr. Vanasek testified: 

 
“We had concerns from the standpoint of negative amortization that was accumulating 
and we had been reassured that in the past, borrowers would negatively amortize during 
difficult times and then make up for the lost payments in good times.  But the percentage 
and the potential percentage for negative amortization was very large, and, of course the 
attendant payment shock was also very large, which was a concern to credit.”364

 

 

Few executives at WaMu shared Mr. Vansek’s concern about the Option ARM.  To the extent 
that risk managers expressed concern, it was outweighed by the product’s favorable gain-on-
sale margin. 

As part of its High Risk Lending Strategy, WaMu determined to increase its issuance of 

its Option ARM loans.  To do that, WaMu had to convince customers to forego a simple, low 
risk conventional loan in favor of the complex and higher risk Option ARM.  In late 2003, 
WaMu conducted two focus group studies to “explore ways to increase sales of Option ARMs, 
Washington Mutual’s most profitable mortgage loan products.”365
examined the views of WaMu loan consultants and third party mortgage brokers.  The second 
focus group examined the views of WaMu Option ARM customers.   

  The first focus group 

 
The report following the first focus group with WaMu loan consultants and mortgage 

brokers identified a number of impediments to selling Option ARMs.  It noted that Option ARM 
                                                 
363 See 8/2006 “Option ARM Credit Risk,” WaMu presentation, at 3, Hearing Exhibit 4/13-37; 10/17/2006 “Option 
ARM” draft presentation to the WaMu Board of Directors, JPM_WM02549027, Hearing Exhibit 4/13-38.

loans had to be “sold” to customers asking for a 30-year fixed loan, and training was needed to 
overcome the feeling of “many” WaMu loan consultants that Option ARMs were “bad” for their 
customers.  The report also recommended increasing commissions so salespersons would take 
the “hour” needed to sell an Option ARM, and increasing loan processing times so salespersons 
and brokers were not inconvenienced.  The report stated in part: 

 
“Option ARMs are sold to customers and few walk through the door and ask for them. ... 

unenthusiastic about the product.  The focus group report stated: 
 

“In general, people do not seem to have a good understanding of their mortgage and its 
terms.  What understanding they do have is framed by the concept of a 30-year fixed 
mortgage.  Option ARMs are very complicated and need to be explained in simple, easy 

                                                 
366 8/14/2003 “Option ARM Focus Groups – Phase I, WaMu Loan Consultants and Mortgage Brokers,” WaMu 
research report, at 2, Hearing Exhibit 4/13-36 [emphasis in original]. 

 

 

 

 

If salespeople don’t understand Option ARMs, they won’t sell them.  Many felt that more 
training would be needed to better educate salespeople about this type of loan, and to 
change the mindset of current Loan Consultants.  Some felt there were many within 
Washington Mutual who simply felt these loans were ‘bad’ for customers, probably from 
a lack of understanding the product and how it could benefit customers.  ... 

It is critical that salespeople fully understand a customer’s financial situation and 
motivation for the loan.  By taking into account these factors, they can recommend the 
loan that will best fit their customers’ needs.  Given today’s low interest rate 
environment, it can be challenging to get salespeople to take the time to do this.  
Currently it is easier to give customers what they ask for (a 30 year fixed loan) than to 
sell them an Option ARM.  They can take 20 minutes and sell a 30 fixed-rate loan, or 
spend an hour trying to sell an Option ARM. 

Commission caps make it unappealing for Mortgage Brokers to sell Washington Mutual 
Option ARMs.  Most would not sell loans to customers with prepayment penalties, and 
given the low commission rate for selling them without the prepayment penalty, many 
simply go to another company or product where they can make more money. 

Slow ARM processing times (up to 90 days) can cause Mortgage Brokers to take 
business elsewhere.  … 
 
Improving collateral would help salespeople better explain Option ARMs to customers 
and take away some of the mystery.  …  They also would like improved brochures which 
talk to the customer in simple, easy to understand terms about features and benefits.  
They liked the current sample statements they are provided.”366
 
The second focus group with existing Option ARM customers showed they were also 

 

106 

to understand terms, prospective borrowers need to be educated about the loan – this is 
not a product that sells itself.”367

 

The focus group identified several reasons that borrowers were leery of Option ARMs 

 
and suggested ways to address the unease:  “Helping prospective borrowers understand payment 
and interest rate caps may mitigate fears of wild monthly payment swings .…  Similarly, fears 
about negative amortization, a concept also not very well understood by the participants, could 
be reduced or eliminated by showing how much residential properties in the local market have 
appreciated over time.”368
 

 

The main findings of the focus group included: 

 

 

 
 

“Few participants fully understood the Option ARM and its key benefits.  A number of 
them were not familiar with the payment options or how they could be used.  …  
Additionally, most did not understand how their interest rate was derived, how often their 
payments would change, and what, if any, were the interest and/or payment caps. 
 
Perhaps the best selling point for the Option ARM loan was being shown how much 
lower their monthly payment would be by choosing an Option ARM versus a fixed-rate 
loan. 
 
Many participants did not know what happened to their loan at the end of the fixed 
interest rate period.  Most of them assumed they would have to sell or refinance because 
of a potential balloon payment or a steep jump in their payments.  Because of these 
misperceptions, most participants expect to refinance their loans within the next three to 
five years.”369
 
To increase Option ARM sales, WaMu increased the compensation paid to its loan 

  

personnel and outside mortgage brokers for the loans.370  The bank also qualified borrowers for 
Option ARMs by using a monthly payment amount that was less than what the borrower would 
likely pay once the loan recast.371

 
The Option ARM was also frequently featured in sales promotion efforts communicated 
to loan officers through WaMu’s internal alert email system known as, “e-Flash.”  For example, 
a June 5, 2006 e-Flash from Steve Stein, the Director of Retail Lending in the Home Loans 
division, to the entire retail sales team announced:

“We are beginning to focus on higher-margin products like our flagship product, the 
Option ARM.  This is a fantastic product for almost any borrower.  To help our sales 
force feel more comfortable with selling the Option ARM to a wide variety of borrowers, 
we are rolling out a comprehensive skills assessment and training initiative.  ...  This 
initiative is not about selling the Option ARM to everyone.  We will always stay true to 
our values and provide the right loan for every customer.  …  Through the skills 
assessment, training, role playing and a best-practices selling tips video, I think this retail 
sales team will be unstoppable with the Option ARM.  …  The Option ARM is our 
product and we can sell it better than anyone.  I have great confidence that we’ll improve 
our Option ARM market share quickly, like the experts that we are.”372
 
One month later, Mr. Stein announced increased compensation incentives for selling 

 

Option ARMs.  In another e-Flash to the entire retail sales team, Mr. Stein wrote: 

 
“You’ve seen and heard a lot recently about our refined business model and focus on 
higher margin products, especially Option ARMs.  To further drive this focus, I’m 
pleased to announce the 2006 Option ARM Blitz – Quarterly Incentive Campaign.  This 
will allow eligible Loan Consultants to earn 5 additional basis points on all Option ARM 
volume funded during the 3rd quarter 2006.”373
 

 

Under the rules of the Option ARM Blitz, loan consultants who increased the percentage of 
Option ARMs they sold by at least 10% would receive an additional bonus.  In August 2006, an 
e-Flash announced that the underwriting guidelines for Option ARMs had been loosened, 
allowing higher loan amounts for “condos and co-ops” and greater loan-to-value ratios for “low-
doc” second home mortgages.374  Also in August, an e-Flash announced that the “Option ARM 
Sales Mastery Program” that was launched in June, would now become part of the mandatory 
loan originator training curricula.375
 
 
consumer direct channel which waived all closing costs for Option ARMs except for an appraisal 
deposit.376  In the fourth quarter of 2006, the consumer direct channel also held a contest called 
the “Fall Kickoff Contest.”  For each of the 13 weeks in the quarter, the loan consultant who 
scored the most points would receive a $100 gift card.  An Option ARM sale was a “touchdown” 
and worth seven points; jumbo-fixed, equity, and nonprime mortgages were only “field goals” 
worth three points.  At the end of the quarter the top five point winners were awarded with a 
$1,000 gift card.377

In September 2006, WaMu introduced pricing incentives for Option ARMs in the 

  In addition, from November 2006 through January 2007, e-Flashes sent to

consumer direct originators promoted Option ARM sales specials offering $1,000 off closing 
costs for loans under $300,000 and a waiver of all fees for loans greater than $300,000.378

 

 
Judging by sales of Option ARMs in 2004, after the completion of the focus groups, 

 

WaMu’s strategy to push sales of Option ARM loans was successful.  In 2003, WaMu originated 
$30.1 billion in Option ARMs; in 2004 WaMu more than doubled its Option ARM originations 
to $67.5 billion.  Although sales of Option ARMs declined thereafter because of challenges in 
the market, in 2006, WaMu still originated $42.6 billion in Option ARMs.  According to its 
internal documents, by 2006, Washington Mutual was the second largest Option ARM originator 
in the country.379

 
As WaMu’s Option ARM portfolio grew, and as the wider economy worsened, the 

 
prevalence of negative amortization in the Option ARMs increased.  While WaMu risk managers 
viewed negative amortization as a liability, WaMu accountants, following generally accepted 
accounting practices, treated negative amortization as an asset.   In 2003, WaMu recognized $7 
million in earnings from deferred interest due to negative amortization.380   By 2006, capitalized 
interest recognized in earnings that resulted from negative amortization surpassed $1 billion; by 
2007 it exceeded $1.4 billion.381  In other words, as WaMu customers stopped paying down their 
mortgages, WaMu booked billions of dollars in earnings from the increasing unpaid balances.  
By another measure, in 2003, $959 million in Option ARM loans that WaMu held in its 
investment portfolio experienced negative amortization; in 2007, the figure was more than $48 
billion.382
 

  

According to data compiled by the Treasury and the FDIC Inspectors General, in 2005, 
 
WaMu borrowers selected the minimum monthly payment option for 56% of the value of the 
Option ARM loans in its investment portfolio.   By the end of 2007, 84% of the total value of the 
Option ARMs in WaMu’s investment portfolio was negatively amortizing.383   To avoid having 
their loans recast at a higher interest rate, Option ARM borrowers typically refinanced the 
outstanding loan balance.  Some borrowers chose to refinance every year or two.384   The 
Treasury and the FDIC IG report determined that a significant portion of Washington Mutual’s 
Option ARM business consisted of refinancing existing loans.385

   

 
One WaMu loan officer, Brian Minkow, told the Subcommittee that he expected the vast 

  As long as home prices were appreciating, most borrowers were able to refinance if 

majority of Option ARMs borrowers to sell or refinance their homes before their payments 
increased.386

they chose to.  According to Mr. Minkow, who was one of WaMu’s top loan consultants and in 
some years originated more than $1 billion in loans, 80% of his business was in Option ARMs, 
and 70% of his business consisted of refinances.387
however, refinancing became difficult.  At recast, many people found themselves in homes they 
could not afford, and began defaulting in record numbers. 

  Once housing prices stopped rising, 

 
WaMu was one of the largest originators of Option ARMs in the country.  In 2006 alone, 

WaMu securitized or sold $115 billion in Option ARMs.388  Like Long Beach securitizations, 
WaMu Option ARM securitizations performed badly starting in 2006, with loan delinquency 
rates between 30 and 50%, and rising.389

 

 
(e)  Marginalization of WaMu Risk Managers 

WaMu knowingly implemented a High Risk Lending Strategy, but failed to establish a 

 
 
corresponding system for risk management.  Instead, it marginalized risk managers who warned 
about and attempted to limit the risk associated with the high risk strategy.   
 

At the time it formally adopted its High Risk Lending Strategy, WaMu executives 

acknowledged the importance of managing the risks it created.  For example, the January 2005 
“Higher Risk Lending Strategy ‘Asset Allocation Initiative’” presentation to the Board of 
Directors Finance Committee stated in its overview: 
 

“In order to generate more sustainable, consistent, higher margins within Washington 
Mutual, the 2005 Strategic Plan calls for a shift in our mix of business, increasing our 
Credit Risk tolerance while continuing to mitigate our Market and Operational Risk 
positions. 

 

“The Corporate Credit Risk Management Department has been tasked, in conjunction 
with the Business Units, to develop a framework for the execution of this strategy.   Our 
numerous activities include: 
 
 
 

-Selecting best available credit loss models 
-Developing analytical framework foundation 
-Identifying key strategy components per Regulatory Guidance documents 

“A strong governance process will be important as peak loss rates associated with this 
higher risk lending strategy will occur with a several year lag and the correlation between 
high risk loan products is important.  For these reasons, the Credit Department will pro-

actively review and manage the implementation of the Strategic Plan and provide 
quarterly feedback and recommendations to the Executive Committee and timely 
reporting to the Board.”390

 

The robust risk management system contemplated by in the January 2005 memorandum, 

 
which was critical to the success of the High Risk Lending Strategy, was never meaningfully 
implemented.  To the contrary, risk managers were marginalized, undermined, and often ignored.  
As former Chief Risk Manager Jim Vanasek testified at the April 13 Subcommittee hearing: 
 

“I made repeated efforts to cap the percentage of high-risk and subprime loans in the 
portfolio.  Similarly, I put a moratorium on non-owner-occupied loans when the 
percentage of these assets grew excessively due to speculation in the housing market.  I 
attempted to limit the number of stated income loans, loans made without verification of 
income.  But without solid executive management support, it was questionable how 
effective any of these efforts proved to be.”391

 

 
Later in the hearing, Mr. Vanasek had the following exchange with Senator Coburn: 
 

Senator Coburn:  Did you ever step in and try to get people to take a more conservative 
approach at WaMu? 

Mr. Vanasek:  Constantly. 

Senator Coburn:  Were you listened to? 

Mr. Vanasek:  Very seldom. 

Senator Coburn:  [Had] you ever felt that your opinions were unwelcomed, and could you 
be specific? 

Mr. Vanasek:  Yes.  I used to use a phrase.  It was a bit of humor or attempted humor.  I 
used to say the world was a very dark and ugly place in reference to subprime loans.  I 
cautioned about subprime loans consistently.392

 

Mr. Vanasek’s description of his efforts is supported by contemporaneous internal 

 
documents.  In a February 24, 2005 memorandum to the Executive Committee with the subject 
heading, “Critical Pending Decisions,” for example, Mr. Vanasek cautioned against expanding 
WaMu’s “risk appetite”:

392 Id. at 32. 

 

111 

“My credit team and I fear that we are considering expanding our risk appetite at exactly 
the wrong point and potentially walking straight into a regulatory challenge and criticism 
from both the Street and the Board.  Said another way I fear that the timing of further 
expansion into higher risk lending beyond what was contemplated in the ’05 Plan and 
most especially certain new products being considered is ill-timed given the overheated 
market and the risk [of] higher interest rates …. 
 
So we come down to the basic question, is this the time to expand beyond the ’05 Plan 
and/or to expand into new categories of higher risk assets?  For my part I think not.  We 
still need to complete EDE [Enterprise Decision Engine, an automated underwriting 
system], reduce policy exception levels, improve the pricing models, build our sub-prime 
collection capability, improve our modeling etc.  We need to listen to our instincts about 
the overheated housing market and the likely outcome in our primary markets.  We need 
to build further credibility with the regulators about the control exercised over our SFR 
underwriting and sub-prime underwriting particularly in LBMC.”393

 

 

 
 
Mr. Vanasek retired in December 2005, in part, because the management support for his 
risk policies and culture was lacking.394  When Mr. Vanasek left WaMu, the company lost one of 
the few senior officers urging caution regarding the high risk lending that came to dominate the 
bank.  After his departure, many of his risk management policies were ignored or discarded.  For 
example, by the end of 2007, stated income loans represented 73% of WaMu’s Option ARMs, 
50% of its subprime loans, and 90% of its home equity loans.395
 
Ronald Cathcart was hired in December 2005 to replace Mr. Vanasek, and became the 
 
Chief Enterprise Risk Officer.  He had most recently been the Chief Risk Officer for Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce’s retail bank.396  Although the High Risk Lending Strategy was 
well underway, after Mr. Vanasek’s departure, risk management was in turmoil.  Mr. Cathcart 
testified at the Subcommittee hearing:  “When I arrived at WaMu, I inherited a Risk Department 
that was isolated from the rest of the bank and was struggling to be effective at a time when the 
mortgage industry was experiencing unprecedented demand for residential mortgage assets.”  In 
early 2006, the bank reorganized WaMu’s risk management.397  Under the new system, much of 
the risk management was subordinated to the WaMu business divisions, with each business 
division’s Chief Risk Officer reporting to two bosses, Mr. Cathcart and the head of the business 
unit to which the division’s Chief Risk Officer was assigned.  WaMu referred to this system of 
reporting as a “Double-Double.”398

Cheryl Feltgen, for example, was the Chief Risk Officer for the Home Loans division.  
She reported both to Mr. Cathcart and to Mr. Schneider, the Home Loans President, setting up a 
tension between the two.399  Mr. Schneider had hired Ms. Feltgen from Citi Mortgage, where she 
had been the Chief Marketing Officer, not a risk manager.  Mr. Cathcart told the Subcommittee 
that he would not have hired her for the role, because of her lack of risk management 
experience.400
 

Ms. Feltgen told the Subcommittee that, although she was the Home Loans Chief Risk 

Officer, she also had responsibility to meet business goals.  She indicated that she did not see her 
role as one of risk minimization, but rather of risk optimization.401  Her 2007 performance 
evaluation reflected her dual responsibilities, but clearly subordinated her risk management 
duties to the achievement of business growth objectives.  For example, the evaluation identified a 
series of goals and assigned each a percentage weighting to determine their precedence.  Instead 
of assigning priority to her performance in the area of managing risk, Ms. Feltgen’s number one 
performance goal for 2007 was “GROWTH” in home loans, given a weighting of 35%, followed 
by “RISK MANAGEMENT,” given a weighting of only 25%.402
  Her performance review even 
listed specific sales targets: 
 

“Employee Goals 
 
GROWTH 35% 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1. Achieve Net Income - $340 MM for 2007 
2. HL [Home Loan] Product Sales (Incl. Conduit) 
 
 
 
 
3. Customer Satisfaction (Total HL) – 55%”403

1. Home Equity - $18B 
2. Subprime - $32B 
3. Option ARM - $33B 
4. Alt A - $10B 

 

 

 

By conditioning her evaluation on whether her division hit pre-determined sales figures, the 
performance evaluation made her compensation more dependent upon the Home Loans division 
hitting revenue growth and product sales than upon her contributions to risk management. 

 
Further complicating matters were Ms. Feltgen’s two supervisors.  In an interview, Ms. 
Feltgen stated that Ron Cathcart, her supervisor on risk matters, was “not well respected” and 
did not have “a strong voice.” 404

  On the other hand, she described David Schneider, her

supervisor on loan origination matters, as having a strong voice and acting more as her boss.  
This arrangement again de-emphasized the importance of her risk duties. 

 
Ms. Feltgen’s dedication to the growth of the Home Loans business is apparent in her 

communications with her staff.  For example, on December 26, 2006, she sent a year-end email 
to her staff.  Under the subject line, “Year-End 2006 Message for the Home Loans Risk 
Management Team,” Ms. Feltgen wrote: 
 

“As we approach the close of 2006, it is fitting to reflect on the challenges and 
accomplishments of this past year and to look forward to 2007 and beyond.  Earlier this 
year David Schneider and the leadership team of Home Loans articulated a new business 
strategy that included: (1) a shift to higher margin products (Alt-A, subprime and home 
equity); (2) reducing market risk … and taking on more credit risk and (3) aggressively 
attacking the cost structure.  We have made great strides as a business on all of those 
fronts and you have all been a part of those accomplishments.  You have partnered 
successfully with the business units of Home Loans in pursuit of our collective goal to 
drive profitable growth with the right balance of risk and return.”405

 

 

The email continued with a list of “accomplishments of the Home Loans Risk 

Management Team in support of business goals,” that included the following accomplishment: 
“Our appetite for credit risk was invigorated with the expansion of credit guidelines for various 
product segments including the 620 to 680 FICO, low docs and also for home equity.”406
  The 
email continued with Ms. Feltgen stating her commitment to the High Risk Lending Strategy and 
emphasizing revenue and sales despite an acknowledgement of the worsening condition of the 
mortgage market: 
 

“The year 2007 will be another challenging year for the mortgage industry with mortgage 
origination volumes down, the inverted yield curve putting pressure on profitability and 
gain on sale margins at lower level than prior years.  The focus on the three key elements 
of our 2006 strategy remains important:  shift to higher margin products, reduce market 
risk and increase credit risk and attack the cost structure.  …  In 2007, we must find new 
ways to grow our revenue.  Home Loans Risk Management has an important role to play 
in that effort. 

David Schneider has encouraged us to ‘BE BOLD’….  Recognize that ‘we are all in 
sales’ passionately focused on delivering great products and service to our customers.”407
 
Ms. Feltgen’s year-end bonus was based upon her performance review.408

  According to 
Mr. Cathcart, in 2007, the bank made bonus distributions more dependent on the performance of

each business line, rather than the performance of the bank as a whole, which largely removed 
his control over compensation of his risk managers.  Mr. Cathcart told the Subcommittee that he 
disagreed with this change because it made his risk managers, who reported to him and to the 
heads of the business units, more beholden to the business heads.  Mr. Cathcart said he 
approached the head of Human Resources, and strongly objected to the change, but was told to 
take it up with Mr. Killinger.  Mr. Cathcart told the Subcommittee that he voiced his objection to 
Mr. Killinger, but Mr. Killinger told him to talk to Mr. Rotella.  He said that he took his 
objection to Mr. Rotella, but was unsuccessful at preventing the policy change.   

 
Mr. Cathcart told the Subcommittee that this change created further separation between 

him and his risk managers, and compromised the independence of risk management.409
testified at the Subcommittee hearing:  

  He 

 
Mr. Cathcart:  The chairman adopted a policy of what he called double reporting, and in 
the case of the Chief Risk Officers, although it was my preference to have them reporting 
directly to me, I shared that reporting relationship with the heads of the businesses so that 
clearly any of the Chief Risk Officers reporting to me had a direct line to management 
apart from me. 
 
Senator Coburn:  And was that a negative or a positive in terms to the ultimate outcome 
in your view? 
 
Mr. Cathcart:  It depended very much on the business unit and on the individual who was 
put in that double situation.  I would say that in the case of home loans, it was not 
satisfactory because the Chief Risk Officer of that business favored the reporting 
relationship to the business rather than to risk.410
 
The subordination of risk management to sales was apparent at WaMu in many other 

 

ways as well.  Tony Meola, the head of home loans sales, reported directly to David Schneider.  
He had direct access to Mr. Schneider and often pushed for more lenient lending standards.  
According to Ms. Feltgen, the sales people always wanted more lenient standards and more 
mortgage products, and Mr. Meola advocated for them.411

   

 
One example was the 80/20 loan, which consisted of a package of two loans issued 

together, an 80% LTV first lien and a 20% LTV second lien, for a total CLTV of 100%.  Ms. 
Feltgen said she was nervous about the product, as a 100% CLTV was obviously very risky.  
WaMu’s automatic underwriting system was not set up to accept such loans, but Mr. Meola 
wanted permission to “side step” the systems issue.412
Ms. Feltgen ultimately signed off on it.  She told the Subcommittee that it was a high risk 

  Mr. Schneider approved the product, and

product, but was priced accordingly, and that it might have been successful if housing prices had 
not declined.413

 
When the housing market began to collapse, a time in which prudent risk management 

 
became even more critical, Mr. Cathcart, the Chief Enterprise Risk Manager, was accorded even 
less deference and authority.  Mr. Cathcart testified at the April 13 Subcommittee hearing: 

 

 

“Financial conditions … deteriorated further in 2007 and 2008.  As head of risk, I began 
to be excluded from key management decisions.  By February 2008, I had been so fully 
isolated that I initiated a meeting with the Director, where I advised that I was being 
marginalized by senior management to the point that I was no longer able to discharge 
my responsibilities as Chief Enterprise Risk Officer of WaMu.  Within several weeks, I 
was terminated by the Chairman.”414
 
During his interview with the Subcommittee Mr. Cathcart provided additional details 

  He said that he initially had extensive 

Mr. Cathcart told the Subcommittee that regulators were also given out-of-date loss 

 
about his marginalization by senior management.415
interaction with the WaMu Board of Directors and presented to the full Board every six months.  
According to Mr. Cathcart, he attended all of the Board meetings until the end of 2007 or the 
beginning of 2008, at which time he was no longer invited.  Mr. Cathcart felt he was excluded 
from Board meetings and calls with investment bankers because he was forthright about 
WaMu’s mortgage loss rates, whereas senior management used older, more favorable numbers.  
According to Mr. Cathcart, during one of the last Board meetings he attended, after a 
presentation on expected mortgage losses, he interjected that the loan loss data being presented 
were already out of date, and the real figures would be much worse.  He also recalled speaking 
up in a 2007 conference call with investment bankers to correct an overly optimistic loss figure.  
According to Mr. Cathcart, he was chastised for his corrections by WaMu management and told 
to leave the credit discussions to another senior manager. 
 
 
projections as the situation worsened, because Mr. Killinger and Mr. Rotella wanted to prevent a 
negative reaction.  Mr. Cathcart said that the loss rates were increasing every week, and the 
regulators were being provided with three-week old information.  Mr. Cathcart told the 
Subcommittee that in February or March 2008, he discovered that Mr. Killinger had provided the 
Director of OTS, John Reich, with out-of-date loss rates.  Mr. Cathcart said that he called a 
meeting with Mr. Dochow, head of the OTS West Regional Office, and provided him with the 
current numbers.  Mr. Cathcart said that Mr. Killinger found out about the meeting and was 
upset.  In April, Mr. Killinger fired Mr. Cathcart.

E.  Polluting the Financial System  
 
Washington Mutual, as the nation’s largest thrift, was a leading issuer of home loans.  

When many of those loans began to go bad, they caused significant damage to the financial 
system. 
 
Washington Mutual originated or acquired billions of dollars of home loans through 

116 

 

multiple channels, including loans originated by its own loan officers, loans brought to the bank 
by third party mortgage brokers, and loans purchased in bulk from other lenders or firms.  Its 
subprime lender, Long Beach, originated billions of dollars in home loans brought to it by third 
party mortgage brokers across the country.  According to a 2007 WaMu presentation, by 2006, 
Washington Mutual was the second largest nonagency issuer of mortgage backed securities in 
the United States, behind Countrywide.416

 
Washington Mutual and Long Beach sold or securitized the vast majority of their 
subprime home loans.  Initially, Washington Mutual kept most of its Option ARMs in its 
proprietary investment portfolio, but eventually began selling or securitizing those loans as well. 
With respect to other loans, such as fixed rate 30-year, Alt A, home equity, and jumbo loans, 
WaMu kept a portion for its own investment portfolio, and sold the rest either to Wall Street 
investors, usually after securitizing them, or to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.   

  
By securitizing billions of dollars in poor quality loans, WaMu and Long Beach were 
able to decrease their risk exposure while passing along risk to others in the financial system. 
They polluted the financial system with mortgage backed securities which later incurred high 
rates of delinquency and loss.   At times, WaMu securitized loans that it had identified as likely 
to go delinquent, without disclosing its analysis to investors to whom it sold the securities, and 
also securitized loans tainted by fraudulent information, without notifying purchasers of the 
fraud that was discovered and known to the bank. 

 
(1) WaMu and Long Beach Securitizations 
 
From 2000 to 2007, Washington Mutual and Long Beach securitized at least $77 billion 

 

in subprime and home equity loans.417  WaMu also sold or securitized at least $115 billion in 
Option ARM loans.418  Between 2000 and 2008, Washington Mutual sold over $500 billion in 
loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, accounting for more than a quarter of every dollar in 
loans WaMu originated.419

According to a 2007 WaMu presentation at a securities investor meeting in New York, in 

2004, WaMu issued $37.2 billion in RMBS securitizations and was the sixth largest RMBS 
issuer in the United States.420  In 2005, it doubled its production, issuing $73.8 billion in 
securitizations, and became the third largest issuer.  In 2006, it issued $72.8 billion and was the 
second largest issuer, behind Countrywide.421

   

 
WaMu and Long Beach’s securitizations produced only RMBS securities.  Although 

WaMu considered issuing CDO securities as well, it never did so.422  From 2004 to 2006, WaMu 
and Long Beach securitized dozens of pools of prime, subprime, Alt A, second lien, home 
equity, and Option ARM loans.423  WaMu and Long Beach also sold “scratch and dent” pools of 
nonperforming loans, including nonperforming primary mortgages, second lien, and Option 
ARMs.424

 

 
At first, Washington Mutual worked with Wall Street firms to securitize its home loans, 

but later built up its own securitization arm, Washington Mutual Capital Corporation (WCC), 
which gradually took over the securitization of both WaMu and Long Beach loans.  WCC was a 
private Washington State corporation that WaMu acquired from another bank in 2001, and 
renamed.425  WCC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Washington Mutual Bank.  In July 
2002, WaMu announced that WCC would act as an institutional broker-dealer handling RMBS 
securities and would work with Wall Street investment banks to market and sell WaMu and 
Long Beach RMBS securities.426
 

     

  It also conducted whole loan sales and credit card 

WCC was initially based in Seattle, and by 2003, had between 30 and 40 employees.427  
In 2004, due to increasing securitizations, WaMu decided to move the headquarters of WCC to 
Manhattan.428  In 2004, for the first time, WCC acted as the lead manager of a WaMu 
securitization.  That same year, WCC initiated a “conduit program” to buy Alt A and subprime 
loans in bulk for securitization.429  WCC issued its first Alt A securitization in 2005, and its first 
subprime securitization in 2006.430

securitizations.431  At its peak, right before the collapse of the subprime securitization market, 
WCC had over 200 employees and offices in Seattle, New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.  The 
majority of WCC employees were based in New York.432  WCC was headed by Tim Maimone, 
WCC President, who reported to David Beck, Executive Vice President in charge of WaMu’s 
Capital Markets Division.  Mr. Beck reported to the President of WaMu’s Home Loans Division, 
David Schneider.433

 

 
At the Subcommittee hearing on April 13, 2010, Mr. Beck explained the role of WCC in 

WaMu and Long Beach securitizations as follows: 

 
“WaMu Capital Corp. acted as an underwriter of securitization transactions generally 
involving Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. or WaMu Asset Acceptance 
Corp.  Generally, one of the two entities would sell loans into a securitization trust in 
exchange for securities backed by the loans in question, and WaMu Capital Corp. would 
then underwrite the securities consistent with industry standards.  As an underwriter, 
WaMu Capital Corp. sold mortgage-backed securities to a wide variety of institutional 
investors.434

 

 
WCC sold WaMu and Long Beach loans and RMBS securities to insurance companies, pension 
funds, hedge funds, other banks, and investment banks.435
Mae and Freddie Mac.  WCC personnel marketed WaMu and Long Beach loans both in the 
United States and abroad.   

  It also sold WaMu loans to Fannie 

 
Before WCC was able to act as a sole underwriter, WaMu and Long Beach worked with 

  The QSPE then issued RMBS securities secured by future cash 

a variety of investment banks to arrange, underwrite, and sell its RMBS securitizations, including 
Bank of America, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill 
Lynch, Royal Bank of Scotland, and UBS.  To securitize its loans, WaMu typically assembled 
and sold a pool of loans to a qualifying special-purpose entity (QSPE) that it established for that 
purpose, typically a trust.436
flows from the loan pool.  Next, the QSPE – working with WCC and usually an investment bank 
– sold the RMBS securities to investors, and used the sale proceeds to repay WaMu for the cost

434 April 13, 2010 Subcommittee Hearing at 53.  Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. (WMMSC) and 
WaMu Asset Acceptance Corp. (WAAC) served as warehouse entities that held WaMu loans intended for later 
securitization.  Mr. Beck explained in his prepared statement:  “WMMSC and WAAC purchased loans from WaMu, 
and from other mortgage originators, and held the loans until they were sold into the secondary market.  WCC was a 
registered broker-dealer and acted as an underwriter of securitization deals for a period of time beginning in 2004 
and ending in the middle of 2007.  In addition to buying and selling mortgage loans, WMMSC acted as a ‘master 
servicer’ of securitizations.  The master servicer collects and aggregates the payments made on loans in a securitized 
pool and forwards those payments to the Trustee who, in turn, distributes those payments to the holders of the 
securities backed by that loan pool.”  Id. at 163.

of the loan pool.  Washington Mutual Inc. generally retained the right to service the loans.  
WaMu or Long Beach might also retain a senior, subordinated, residual, or other interest in the 
loan pool. 

 
The following two diagrams created for a 2005 Long Beach securitization, LBMC 2005-

“waterfall” constructed to determine how the mortgage payments being made into the 
securitization pool would be used.437

In that particular securitization, Goldman Sachs served as the lead underwriter, WCC served as 
the securities dealer, Deutsche Bank served as the trustee of the trust set up to hold the securities, 
and Long Beach served as the mortgage servicer.   

 
Another document, prepared by Goldman Sachs, shows the variety of relationships that 
WaMu engaged in as part of its securitization efforts.438  That document, which consists of a list 
of various loan pools and related matters, shows that WaMu worked with Goldman Sachs to 
make whole loan sales; securitize loans insured by the Federal Home Administration or Veterans 
Administration; and securitize prime, subprime, Alt A, second lien, and scratch and dent 
nonperforming loans.  It also shows that Goldman Sachs asked WaMu and Long Beach to 
repurchase more than $19.7 million in loans it had purchased from the bank.439

   

 
Goldman Sachs handled a number of securitizations for Long Beach.  At one point in 

2006, Goldman Sachs made a pitch to also handle loans issued by WaMu.  One Goldman Sachs 
broker explained to a colleague in an email:  “They have possibly the largest subprime portfolio 
on the planet.”440

  

 
(2) Deficient Securitization Practices 

 

Over the years, both Long Beach and Washington Mutual were repeatedly criticized by 

the bank’s internal auditors and reviewers, as well as its regulators, OTS and the FDIC, for 
deficient lending and securitization practices.  Their mortgage backed securities were among the 
worst performing in the marketplace due to poor quality loans that incurred early payment 
defaults, fraud, and high delinquency rates.   
 
 
recounted eight years of abysmal performance by Long Beach securities, noting that loan 
delinquencies and losses occurred in pools containing both fixed rate and adjustable rate 
mortgages: 
 

Long Beach Securitizations.  In April 2005, an internal email sent by an OTS regulator 

“[Securitizations] prior to 2003 have horrible performance ….  For FRM [fixed rate 
mortgage] losses, LBMC finished in the top 12 worst annual NCLs [net credit losses] in 
1997 and 1999 thru 2003.  LBMC nailed down the number 1 spot as top loser with an 
NCL of 14.1% in 2000 and placed 3rd in 2001 with 10.5% ....  For ARM losses, LBMC 
really outdid themselves with finishes as one of the top 4 worst performers for 1999 thru 
2003.  For specific ARM deals, LBMC made the top 10 worst deal list from 2000 thru 
2002.  LBMC had an extraordinary year in 2001 when their securitizations had 4 of the 
top 6 worst NCLs (range: 11.2% to 13.2%).

“Although underwriting changes were made from 2002 thru 2004, the older issues are 
still dragging down overall performance.  Despite having only 8% of UPB [unpaid 
balances] in 1st lien FRM pools prior to 2002 and only 14.3% in 2002 jr. lien pools, 
LBMC still had third worst delinquencies and NCLs for most of [the] period graphed 
from 11/02 thru 2/05 and was 2nd worst in NCLs in 2005 out of 10 issuers graphed. …  
At 2/05, LBMC was #1 with a 12% delinquency rate.  Industry was around 8.25%.  At 
3/05, LBMC had a historical NCL rate of 2% smoking their closest competitor by 70bp 
and tripling the industry average.”441
 
This email, which is based upon a 2005 Fitch analysis of Long Beach, shows that, 

 

from 1997 to March 2005, due to loan delinquencies and losses, Long Beach securities 
were among the very worst performing in the entire subprime industry.442

   

 
Long Beach’s performance did not improve after 2005.  In April 2006, for 

example, Nomura Securities issued an analysis of the ABX Index that tracked a basket of 
20 subprime RMBS securities and identified Long Beach as the worst performer: 

 
“Long Beach Mortgage Loan Trust appears to be the poorest performing issuer, with its 
three deals averaging 15.67% in 60+ day delinquency and 12.75% in 90+ day 
delinquency.  Unsurprisingly, all three deals issued by LBMLT have exceeded their 
delinquency trigger limits.”443
 
In November 2006, while attending the Asset Backed Securities East Conference 

 

for the securitization industry, the head of WaMu’s Capital Markets Division, David 
Beck, emailed WaMu’s Home Loans President, David Schneider, that with respect to 
RMBS securities carrying noninvestment grade ratings, “LBMC [Long Beach] paper is 
among the worst performing paper in the mkt [market] in 2006.  Subordinate buyers want 
answers.”444
 
 
In March 2007, an analysis by JPMorgan Chase again singled out Long Beach securities 
for having the worst delinquency rates among the subprime securities tracked by the ABX Index: 

 

 
“Washington Mutual Inc.’s subprime bonds are suffering from some of the worst rates of 
delinquency among securities in benchmark indexes, according to JPMorgan Chase & 
Co. research. …  Delinquencies of 60 days or more on loans supporting WaMu’s Long 
Beach LBMLT 2006-1 issue jumped … to 19.44 percent … the highest among the 20

risky borrowers.”445
 
In July 2007, Moody’s and S&P downgraded the credit ratings of hundreds of subprime 
RMBS and CDO securities, due to rising mortgage delinquencies and defaults.  Included were 
approximately 40 Long Beach securities.446  A July 12, 2007 presentation prepared by Moody’s 
to explain its ratings action shows that Long Beach was responsible for only 6% of all the 
subprime RMBS securities issued in 2006, but received 14% of the subprime RMBS ratings 
downgrades that day.447

  Only Fremont had a worse ratio. 

 
Over time, even AAA rated Long Beach securities performed terribly.  Of the 75 Long 

Beach mortgage backed security tranches rated AAA by Standard and Poor’s in 2006, all 75 
have been downgraded to junk status, defaulted, or been withdrawn.448  In most of the 2006 
Long Beach securitizations, the underlying loans have delinquency rates of 50% or more.449
 

 
 
The problems were not confined to Long Beach loans.  In early 2008, for example, an 
investment adviser posted information on his personal blog about a WaMu-sponsored RMBS 
securitization known as WMALT 2007-OC1.  Formed in May 2007, this pool contained about 
1,700 Alt A loans with a total outstanding balance of about $515 million.  WaMu was the sole 
underwriter.  The credit rating agencies gave AAA and other investment grade ratings to more 
than 92% of the securitization, but within eight months, 15% of the pool was in foreclosure.  The 
posting suggested that the poor performance of WaMu securities was systemic. 
 

When informed by David Schneider of the complaint about the negative publicity 

surrounding the pool, David Beck responded:  
 

“Yes (ughh!) we are doing some peer group performance and looking at the servicing 
data … and putting together an analysis.  …  The collateral is full of limited doc layered 
risk alt a paper and at least half is TPO [third party originated].  The performance is not 
great but my opinion is not a WaMu specific issue.”450

Home Loans President David Schneider replied:  “Ok – thanks .…  Are we sure there isn’t a 
reporting issue?”  Today, those securities have all been downgraded to junk status and more than 
half of the underlying loans are delinquent or in foreclosure.451
 

 

Despite their poor performance, it is unclear that any investment bank refused to do 

business with either Long Beach or WaMu.  As long as investors expressed interest in 
purchasing the securities, banks continued selling them until the entire subprime market 
collapsed.  Before the market collapsed, WaMu earned hundreds of millions of dollars a year 
from its home loans sales and securitizations.452

   

 
Securitizing Fraudulent Loans.  WaMu and Long Beach securitized not just poor 

quality loans, but also loans that its own personnel had flagged as containing fraudulent 
information.  That fraudulent information included, for example, misrepresentations of the 
borrower’s income and of the appraised value of the mortgaged property.  In September 2008, 
WaMu’s Corporate Credit Review team released a report which found that internal controls 
intended to prevent the sale of fraudulent loans to investors were ineffective:   
 

“The controls that are intended to prevent the sale of loans that have been confirmed by 
Risk Mitigation to contain misrepresentations or fraud are not currently effective.  There 
is not a systematic process to prevent a loan in the Risk Mitigation Inventory and/or 
confirmed to contain suspicious activity from being sold to an investor.  ...   Of the 25 
loans tested, 11 reflected a sale date after the completion of the investigation which 
confirmed fraud.  There is evidence that this control weakness has existed for some 
time.”453
 

  

In other words, even loans marked with a red flag indicating fraud were being sold to investors.  
The review identified several factors contributing to the problem, including insufficient resources 
devoted to anti-fraud work, an absence of automated procedures to alert personnel to fraud 
indicators, and inadequate training on fraud awareness and prevention.  The 2008 review 
warned:  “Exposure is considerable and immediate corrective action is essential in order to limit 
or avoid considerable losses, reputation damage, or financial statement errors.”454
 

 
(3)  Securitizing Delinquency-Prone Loans 

The Subcommittee uncovered an instance in 2007 in which WaMu securitized certain 

 
 
types of loans that it had identified as most likely to go delinquent, but did not disclose its 
analysis to investors who bought the securities.  Investors who purchased these securities without 
the benefit of that analysis quickly saw the value of their purchases fall. 

 

                                                 
451 As of December 2010, the total loan delinquency rate of the WMALT 2007-OC1 series was 57.37%. See 
wamusecurities.com.

WaMu securitization agreements prohibited the bank from using an “adverse selection” 

process when including loans within a securitized pool.  On March 22, 2007, WaMu filed a 
prospectus for WMALT Series 2007-OA3, in which Washington Mutual Bank and Washington 
Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. co-sponsored a securitization of a $2.3 billion pool of Option 
ARM loans.  In the section entitled, “Representations and Warranties Regarding the Mortgage 
Loans,” the prospectus stated: 
 

“Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. and Washington Mutual Bank, as 
applicable, used no adverse selection procedures in selecting the mortgage loans from 
among the outstanding adjustable rate conventional mortgage loans owned by it which 
were available for sale and as to which the representations and warranties in the mortgage 
loan sale agreement could be made.”455

 

On the following page of the prospectus, under the section heading, “Criteria for 

 
Selection of Mortgage Loans,” it stated: 
 

“Each co-sponsor selected the mortgage loans it sold to the depositor from among its 
portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale based on a variety of considerations, including 
type of mortgage loan, geographic concentration, range of mortgage interest rates, 
principle balance, credit scores and other characteristics described in Appendix B to this 
prospectus supplement, and taking into account investor preferences and the depositor’s  
objective of obtaining the most favorable combination of ratings on the certificates.”456
 

WaMu emails and memoranda obtained by the Subcommittee indicate that, prior to 
 
assembling the loan pool used in the WMALT 2007-OA3 securitization, WaMu identified 
delinquency-prone Option ARM mortgages in its “Held for Investment” loan portfolio and 
transferred those loans to its portfolio of mortgages available for sale or securitization.  WaMu 
then used its “Held for Sale” loan portfolio to select the loans for the loan pool used in the 
WMALT 2007-OA3 securitization.   The prospectus provides a list of criteria used to select the 
loans in the WMALT 2007-OA3 loan pool, but omits any mention of the fact that some of the 
loans were selected using statistical analysis designed to identify Option ARM loans likely to go 
delinquent quickly.  The internal emails demonstrate that WaMu selected delinquency-prone 
loans for sale in order to move risk from the bank’s books to the investors in WaMu securities, 
and profit from its internal analysis, which was not available to the market. 
 
 
WCC, sent David Beck, head of WaMu’s Capital Markets Division, with copies to others, an 
email regarding “Tom Casey visit,” with the importance marked “high.”  Tom Casey was then 
the Chief Financial Officer of Washington Mutual Bank.  In the email Mr. Drastal relayed Mr. 
Casey’s concern about WaMu’s exposure to Option ARM loans:  

On Thursday, September 14, 2006, John Drastal, then Senior Managing Director of

“Tom just stopped by after the Lehman investor conference.  He says equity investors are 
totally freaking about housing now.  He asked how we could prepare for this.  A few 
items …. 

“2. On the portfolio side, he asked about exposure on option ARMs.  We talked about 
looking to potentially sell ’06 production Option ARMs in portfolio.  He even said 
looking at this quarter.  I don’t think that this is possible but we should look at what the 
credit composition of this product is and see if we can sell quickly if it’s the right thing to 
do (see Nagle’s message).  He doesn’t for[e]see a tainting issue if we are doing it for 
credit issues.  Youyi, can you get me a collateral strat from the portfolio?”457

 

 

 

 

 

 

Three months later, on Wednesday, February 14, 2007, a WaMu portfolio analyst and 

 
trader, Michael Liu, sent an email to a senior official in WaMu’s portfolio management 
department, Richard W. Ellson, with the subject line:  “Option ARM MTA and Option ARM 
MTA Delinquency.”  The email included the abbreviations “MTA,” which stands for “Monthly 
Treasury Average,” and “PPD,” which stands for “Payment Past Due.”  The email provided a 
description of Option ARM loans in WaMu’s investment portfolio that were delinquent in the 
fourth quarter of 2006: 
 

“Hi Rick, 

“Attached is the spreadsheet with the total Option ARM MTA … and Option ARM MTA 
>=1 PPD summary.  Some points for the Option ARM MTA >=1PPD: 

• $105mm in Nonaccrual is between FICO 501-540. 
• $222mm in Nonaccrual between LTV 61-80. 
• CA [California] represents the greatest amount of Delinquency (1PPD, 2PPD, 
3PPD, nonaccrual)[.] 
• Loans originated in 2004 and 2005 represent the highest amount of 3 PPD and 
nonaccrual[.]”458
 

 

On the same day, Mr. Ellson forwarded the email to the Division Executive for Portfolio 

 
Management and Research, Youyi Chen, with the following comments: 

“Youyi – attached is a description of the Option ARMs that were delinquent in the 
2006q4 [fourth quarter].  You can see that it is very much a function of FICOs and Low 
Doc loans.  We are in the process of updating the optimum pricing matrix.  Mike did the 
work.  Your comments are appreciated.”459

128 

 
 
Mr. Chen, in turn, forwarded the email to the head of WaMu’s Capital Markets Division, 
David Beck.  Mr. Chen’s introductory comments indicated that the research had been performed 
in response to a question from WaMu Home Loans President David Schneider and was intended 
to identify criteria for the loans driving delinquencies in the Option ARM portfolio: 

“This answers partially [David] Schneider’s questions on break down of the option arm 
delinquencies. 

The details (1PPD tab) shows Low fico, low doc, and newer vintages are where most of 
the delinquency comes from, not a surprise.”460

 

On the same day, February 14, Mr. Beck forwarded the entire email chain to David 

 
Schneider and WaMu Home Loans Risk Officer Cheryl Feltgen, adding his own view: 

“Please review.  The performance of newly minted option arm loans is causing us 
problems.  Cheryl can validate but my view is our alt a (high margin) option arms [are] 
not performing well. 

We should address selling 1Q [first quarter] as soon as we can before we loose [sic] the 
oppty.  We should have a figure out how to get this feedback to underwriting and 
fulfillment.”461

 

Mr. Beck’s message indicated that recently issued Option ARM loans were not 

performing well, and suggested selling them before the bank lost the opportunity.  WaMu would 
lose the opportunity to sell those loans if, for example, they went delinquent, or if the market 
realized what WaMu analysts had already determined about their likelihood of going delinquent.  
Mr. Beck’s email proposed selling the loans during the first quarter of the year, already six 
weeks underway, and “as soon as we can.” 
 
 
requesting Ms. Feltgen’s thoughts.  Later that day, Ms. Feltgen responded with additional 
analysis and an offer to help further analyze the Option ARM delinquencies: 

Four days later, on Sunday, February 18, Mr. Schneider replied to the email chain by 

“The results described below are similar to what my team has been observing.  
California, Option ARMs, large loan size ($1 to $2.5 million) have been the fastest 
increasing delinquency rates in the SFR [Single Family Residence] portfolio.  Although 
the low FICO loans have … higher absolute delinquency rates, the higher FICOs have 
been increasing at a faster pace than the low FICOs.  Our California concentration is 
getting close to 50% and many submarkets within California actually have declining 
house prices according to the most recent OFHEO [Office of Federal Housing Enterprise 
Oversight] data from third quarter of 2006.  There is a meltdown in the subprime market 
which is creating a ‘flight to quality’.  I was talking to Robert Williams just after his

return from the Asia trip where he and Alan Magleby talked to potential investors for 
upcoming covered bond deals backed by our mortgages.  There is still strong interest 
around the world in USA residential mortgages.  Gain on sale margins for Option ARMs 
are attractive.  This seems to me to be a great time to sell as many Option ARMs as we 
possibly can.  Kerry Killinger was certainly encouraging us to think seriously about it at 
the MBR [Monthly Business Review] last week.  What can I do to help?  David, would 
your team like any help on determining the impact of selling certain groupings of Option 
ARMs on overall delinquencies?  Let me know where we can help.  Thanks.”462

 

As Chief Risk Officer in WaMu’s Home Loans division, Ms. Feltgen pointed out some 

counterintuitive features of the latest delinquencies, noting that the fastest increases in 
delinquencies occurred in large loans and loans with high FICO scores.  She also noted that the 
subprime meltdown had led to a “flight to quality,” and that foreign investors still had a strong 
interest in U.S. residential mortgages, suggesting that WaMu might be able to sell its likely-to-go 
delinquent Option ARMs to those foreign investors.  From her perspective as a risk manager, she 
urged selling “as many Option ARMs as we can.” 

 
Her email also indicated that the topic of selling more Option ARMs had come up during 

the prior week at the monthly business review meeting, in which WaMu CEO Killinger 
expressed interest in exploring the idea.463
  Finally, Ms. Feltgen offered help in analyzing the 
impact of selling “certain groupings of Options ARMs” on overall delinquencies.  Removing 
those problematic loans from the larger pool of Option ARM loans in the bank’s investment 
portfolio would reduce loan delinquencies otherwise affecting the value of the portfolio as a 
whole. 

 
Mr. Schneider sent a second email at 11:00 at night that same Sunday providing 

 
instructions for moving forward: 

“Let[’]s do the following: 
1. db [David Beck] - please select the potential sample portfolios - along the lines we 
discussed at the mbr [Monthly Business Review] 
2. cf [Cheryl Feltgen] - please run credit scenarios 
3. db - coordinate with finance on buy/sell analysis 
4. db/cf – recommendation[.]”464

 

 

On Tuesday morning, February 20, 2007, Mr. Beck replied with additional analysis: 

 

 

 

 

 

“Here’s how I see this going. 

                                                 
462 Id. 
463 At the end of 2006, WaMu held about $63.5 billion in Option ARM mortgages, then comprising about 28% of its 
investment portfolio.  See 3/2007 Washington Mutual Inc. 10-K filing with the SEC, at 52.

From the MBR [Monthly Business Review], my notes indicate two portfolios we 
discussed for sale; the 2007 high margin production (Jan and Feb so far) and the seasoned 
COFI book.465
 
I will supply to Cheryl the loan level detail on both pools and the pricing assumptions for 
losses.  Cheryl, you need to run scenario analysis and on losses versus pricing AND 
reserving assumptions.  I can supply pricing assumptions but would like you to pull the 
ALLL [Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses] against these pools.”466

 

Later that day, Ms. Feltgen forwarded the email chain to her team, changing the subject 

 
line to read:  “URGENT NEED TO GET SOME WORK DONE IN THE NEXT COUPLE 
DAYS: Option ARM MTA and Option ARM MTA Delinquency.”  Clearly, time was of the 
essence: 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 

“See the attached string of emails.  We are contemplating selling a larger portion of our 
Option ARMs than we have in the recent past.  Gain on sale is attractive and this could be 
a way to address California concentration, rising delinquencies, falling house prices in 
California with a favorable arbitrage given that the market seems not to be yet 
discounting a lot for those factors.  David Schneider has set a meeting for Friday morning 
with David Beck and me to hear our conclusions and recommendations.  See the 
comments below about the information that we need to provide for this analysis.  We will 
get the pools by tomorrow at the latest.  We will need to coordinate with Joe Mattey and 
get input from him in order to make a judgment regarding the ALLL impact.  ... 

In addition to the specific information that David Beck asks for, I would like your input 
on portions of the Option ARM portfolio that we should be considering selling.  We may 
have a different view than David Beck’s team as to the most desirable to sell and we 
should provide that input.  Our suggestion, for instance, might include loans in California 
markets where housing prices are declining.  There may be other factors.  

I will need to get from you by Thursday, February 22 end of day a summary of our 
conclusions and recommendations.”467

 

                                                 
465 Option ARMs were considered a “high margin” product within WaMu, because they produced a relatively high 
gain on sale when sold.  See 4/18/2006 Washington Mutual Home Loans Discussion Board of Directors Meeting, at 
JPM_WM00690894, Hearing Exhibit 4/13-3 (chart showing gain on sale margin by product). “COFI” stands for 
“Cost of Funds Index” which is an index used to set variable interest rates.  “Seasoned” means the loans are older 
production.

that were driving delinquencies in the Option ARM portfolio:  

A WaMu risk analyst, Robert Shaw, replied the same day and identified specific factors 

131 

 
“Cheryl, 
 

 

 

 

 between 1/06 - 1/07 [January 6 and 7].  The results of this 

I reviewed the HFI [Hold for Investment] prime loan characteristics that contributed to 
rising 60+ delinquency rates468
analysis show that seven combined factors contain $8.3 billion HFI Option ARM 
balances which experienced above-average increases in the 60+ delinquency rate during 
the last 12 months (a 821% increase, or 10 times faster than the average increase of 79%).  
I recommend that we select loans with some or all of these characteristics to develop a 
HFS [Hold for Sale] pool.   
 
Below, I have listed the factors (layered), their percentage change in 60+ delinquency 
rate over the last 12 months, and HFI balances as of January 2007.469

 

1)  HFI Option ARMs – 79% increase (.56% to 1.0%), $60.6 billion 
2)  Above + Vintages 2004-2007 – 179% increase (.33% to .92%), $47.8 billion 
3)  Above + CA – 312% increase (.16 to .66%), $23.7 billion 
4)  Above + NY/NJ/CT – 254% increase (.21 to .76%), $29.3 billion 
5)  Above + $351k-1mil – 460% increase (.12 to .70%), $17.2 billion 
6)  Above + FICO 700-739 – 1197% increase (.03% to .40%), $4.2 billion 
7)  Above + FICO 780+ – 1484% increase (.02% to .38%), $5.2 billion 
8)  Above + FICO 620-659 – 821% increase (.07 to .67%), $8.3 billion[.]”470

 

 
Essentially, the key factors identified Option ARMs that were in certain states, like California, 
had certain FICO scores or certain loan amounts, or were issued during the period 2004-2007. 
 
 
and Mr. Ellson.  Her email carried the subject line: “Some thoughts on target population for

ARMs we are considering for sale.  I thought it might be helpful insight to see the 
information Bob Shaw provides below about the components of the portfolio that have

exercise about gain on sale, but we might also be able to accomplish the other purpose of

heading, “HFI Option Arms redirect to HFS,” to much of WaMu’s top management, including 
Mr. Schneider, Mr. Rotella, Mr. Casey, as well as the FDIC Examiner-In-Charge Steve Funaro, 
and others.  The email indicated that a decision had been made to sell $3 billion in recent Option 
ARM loans, with as many as possible to be sold before the end of the quarter, which was four 
weeks away: 
 

“David [Schneider] and I spoke today.  He’s instructed me to take actions to sell all 
marketable Option Arms that we intend to transfer to portfolio in 1Q[first quarter], 2007.  
That amounts to roughly 3B [$3 billion] option arms availab[l]e for sale.  I would like to 
get these loans into HFS [the Hold for Sale portfolio] immediately so that [I] can sell as 
many as possible in Q1. 
 
John [Drastal], we are only targeting to sell Option Arms destined for portfolio since year 
end at this point.  I’ll need direction from you on any special accounting concerns or 
documentation you will need to get these loans in the warehouse without tainting the HFI

Michelle, I believe this action requires MRC [Market Risk Committee] approval.  Please 
advise. 
 
This week I’ll work to get the necessary governance sign offs in place.  Cheryl, please 
direct me on what form the approval request should take and what committees should 
review and authorize the request.  I can pull all of the data.

risks in our prime portfolio and recommend actions to mitigate them.

472 Loans in a bank’s Hold for Investment portfolio receive different accounting treatment than loans in the bank’s 
Hold for Sale portfolio, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) frown upon frequent transfers 
between the two portfolios.  The GAAP principles were a key reason for Mr. Beck’s instruction that the transfer of 
the Option ARM loans from WaMu’s HFI to HFS portfolios proceed “without tainting the HFI book.”

stated after closing. 

e.  3-4 units (excessive S & P level hit calls for portfolio execution) 
 

2.  Further more, we would like to request, transferring from HFI to HFS, all the MTA 
option ARMs and COFI ARMs, funded or locked between January 1st, 2007 to 
Mach [sic] 7th, 2007, and DO NOT fit the criteria listed above, and DO NOT fit the 
criteria section 3.02 to 4.07 in the attached ‘existing HFI descriptions’) 

As a result of this change, we expected to securitize and settle about $ 2 billion more 
option/COFI ARMs in Q1-07 (mostly margin greater than 295), and going forward $ 1 
billion per month potential incremental volume into HFS.  For your information, the 
impact to gain on sale for the year is estimated to be about $180 MM pretax based on 
current market, and the impacts to 2007 portfolio NII is estimated to be about - $ 80 MM 
pretax.  
 

Also included in the attachment, is a pool of $1.3 billion option/COFI ARMs funded to 
portfolio between January 1st and February 22nd that will be re-classified as HFS based 
on the above recommendations.  We understand that this population of loans will be 
growing from now to March 7th until the portfolio selection criteria are officially 
modified. 

We expected to start marketing the deal on March 12th, your prompt response will be 
greatly appreciated as the TSG [Technology Solutions Group] and QRM [Quantitative 
Risk Management] teams also need time to implement the coding changes.”476

This email proposed several significant changes to WaMu’s treatment of its Option 

 
 
ARMs.  First, WaMu decided to require most of its Option ARMs to go directly into its Hold for 
Sale portfolio instead of going into its Held for Investment portfolio.  In light of its analysis that 
Option ARM loans were rapidly deteriorating, the bank no longer wanted to treat them as 
investments it would keep, but immediately sell them.  Second, the only Option ARMs that it 
would automatically direct into its investment portfolio were those that the bank considered to be 
so obviously of poor quality that they were “non-salable,” according to another internal email.477
  
Third, WaMu proposed transferring all Option ARM loans originated in 2007 from the 
investment portfolio to the sale portfolio.  Since these three changes in how WaMu would treat 
its Option ARMs had compliance, accounting, and tax consequences, they had to be approved by 
the Market Risk Committee. That Committee was composed of senior risk officers throughout 
the bank as well as senior managers in the bank’s finance, treasury, and portfolio management 
departments.  The email indicated that the changes needed to be implemented within about a 
week so that marketing of some of the Option ARMs could begin by March 12. 
 
 
proposal.  The minutes of that meeting describe the changes that had been proposed: 

On March 9, 2007 the Market Risk Committee met and approved the Option ARM 

“- Change the Held for Investment (HFI) ARM and COFI ARM retention criteria to 
include only the following loans for HFI effective March 12, 2007; Super jumbo ≥ $3.0 
million, Advantage 90, Foreign Nationals, FICO < 620 except employee loans in which 
case FICO can be re-stated after closing, and 3 to 4 units.   
- Increase Prime Option ARM’s (including Second Liens) from $26.0 billion to $37.0 
billion. 
- Transfer up to $3.0 billion of saleable Option ARM and COFI ARM loans originated 
between January 1, 2007 and March 12, 2007 from HFI to HFS (excluding HFI loans 
described above).”478

 

 

 

 

 

The minutes also recorded an exchange between Ms. McCarthy and another Committee 

 
member, Mr. Woods, who was the Chief Financial Officer of WaMu’s Home Loans division: 

“A second part of the proposal requests approval to transfer up to $3.0 billion of saleable 
Option ARM and COFI ARM loans originated since January 1, 2007 from HFI to Held 
for Sale (HFS).  In response to a question from Mr. Woods, Ms. McCarthy explained that 
there are other Option ARM loans not included in the criteria that we are retaining in 
portfolio.  Ms. McCarthy noted that Ms. Feltgen ha[d] reviewed and approved this 
proposal.  Mr. Woods noted that Deloitte has reviewed the proposal as well.”479

reasons.”).

This exchange acknowledges that not all of the saleable Option ARM loans were diverted from 
the HFI to the HFS portfolio.  WaMu chose to keep some Option ARMs and make other Option 
ARMs available for sale.  The internal WaMu documents and communications reviewed by the 
Subcommittee strongly suggest that the decision to transfer the most recently originated Option 
ARMs from the Held-for-Investment portfolio to the Held-for-Sale portfolio was part of an effort 
to sell loans thought to be prone to delinquency, before they became delinquent.  None of the 
hearing witnesses recalled how these loans were specifically selected for securitization, nor did 
any deny that they may have been selected for their propensity toward delinquency.480
 
 
The Subcommittee investigation determined that WaMu carried out the plan as approved, 
and transferred at least $1.5 billion Option ARMs originated in the first quarter of 2007, from the 
HFI to HFS portfolio.  Of these loans, about 1,900 with a total value of a little over $1 billion 
were assembled into a pool and used in the WMALT 2007-OA3 securitization in March 2007.481  
WMALT 2007-OA3 securities were issued with WaMu as the sole underwriter and sold to 
investors.482
 
 
None of the materials associated with the sale of the WMALT 2007-OA3 securities 
informed investors of the process used to select the delinquency-prone Option ARMs from 
WaMu’s investment portfolio and include them in the securitization.483
  Nor did WaMu inform 
investors of the internal analysis it performed to identify the delinquency-prone loans.  Senator 
Levin questioned Mr. Beck about this point at the April 13 Subcommittee hearing: 
 

 

 

Senator Levin.  When you said that investors were told of the characteristics of loans, 
they were told of all the characteristics of loans.  Did they know, were they informed that 
loans with those or some of those characteristics had a greater propensity towards 
delinquency in WaMu’s analysis?  Were they told that? 
 
Mr. Beck.  They were not told of the WaMu analysis.484

  

 

Predictably, the securitization performed badly.  Approximately 87% of the securities 

received AAA ratings.485  Within 9 months, by January 2008, those ratings began to be 
downgraded.486

   As of February 2010, more than half of the loans in WMALT Series 2007-OA3

(4)  WaMu Loan Sales to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 

 

Washington Mutual had longstanding relationships with a number of government 

sponsored enterprises (GSEs), including the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie 
Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).488  Between 2000 and 
2008, Washington Mutual sold over $500 billion in loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
accounting for more than a quarter of every dollar in loans WaMu originated.489
  While the 
majority of those loans involved lower risk, fixed rate mortgages, WaMu also sold Fannie and 
Freddie billions of dollars in higher risk Option ARMs.  
 

Relationships with Fannie and Freddie.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase 

residential mortgages that meet specified underwriting standards and fall below a specified dollar 
threshold, so-called “conforming loans.”  They often enter into multi-year contracts with large 
mortgage issuers to purchase an agreed-upon volume of conforming loans at agreed-upon rates.  
Prior to 2005, Washington Mutual sold most of its conforming loans to Fannie Mae, with 
relatively little business going to Freddie Mac.490  From at least 1999 through 2004, WaMu sold 
those loans to Fannie Mae through a long term “Alliance Agreement,”491 that resulted in its 
providing more than 85% of its conforming loans to Fannie Mae.492  In 2004, WaMu calculated 
that it “contributed 15% of Fannie Mae’s 2003 mortgage business,”493 and was “Fannie Mae’s 
2nd largest provider of business (behind Countrywide).”494
   Among the advantages that WaMu 
believed it gained from its relationship with Fannie Mae were help with balance sheet

JPM_WM02575608.  As mentioned earlier, GSEs are Congressionally chartered, nongovernment owned financial 
institutions created for public policy purposes.  At the time of the financial crisis, the GSEs included Fannie Mae, 
Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLBS), all of which were created by Congress to 
strengthen the availability of capital for home mortgage financing.

was passed by Congress to encourage banks to make loans in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  See 
website of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, “Community Reinvestment Act,” 
http://www.ffiec.gov/cra/history.htm.  Regulators, including the Office of Thrift Supervision, periodically reviewed 
banks’ CRA activities and took them into account if a bank applied for deposit facilities or a merger or acquisition.  
Id.  A 2005 presentation prepared by WaMu stated that its relationship with Freddie Mac helped the bank meet its 
CRA goals by purchasing more than $10 billion in qualifying loans.  See 9/29/2005 “GSE Forum,” presentation 
prepared by WaMu Capital Markets, at JPM_WM02575611, Hearing Exhibit 4/16-91.  Between 1991 and 2006, 
WaMu was evaluated 20 times by OTS and the FDIC, achieving the highest possible CRA rating of “Outstanding” 
in each evaluation.  See website of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, ratings search for 
“Washington Mutual,” http://www.ffiec.gov/craratings/default.aspx.  Regulations state that an “outstanding” 
institution is one that not only meets the needs of its surrounding community, but utilizes “innovative or flexible 
lending practices.” See 12 C.F.R. 345, Appendix A, http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/2000-

Despite Fannie Mae’s long history with WaMu, in 2005, the bank made a major change 

and shifted the majority of its conforming loan business to Freddie Mac.  WaMu made the 
change in part because its long term contract with Fannie Mae was up for renegotiation,497 and 
Freddie Mac offered better terms.  According to WaMu, Freddie Mac had purchased $6 billion 
of its Option ARM loans in 2004, without a contract in place, and WaMu wanted to sell more of 
those loans.498  WaMu conducted detailed negotiations with both firms that lasted more than six 
months.499  Internally, it considered a number of issues related to switching the majority of its 
conforming loans to Freddie Mac.500  The deciding factor was Freddie Mac’s offer to purchase 
100% of WaMu’s conforming Option ARM mortgages which were among the bank’s most 
profitable loans.501
Freddie, WaMu wrote: 

 In January 2005, in a document comparing the proposals from Fannie and 

 
“The Freddie Mac Business Relationship [proposal] dated 12/21/2004 establishes another 
execution opportunity that diversifies WaMu’s execution risk and confers material 
financial benefits for the Option ARM product.  The key to the Freddie proposal is that it 
provides significant liquidity for our Option ARM originations, with more advantageous 
credit parameters, competitive g-fees and preferred access to their balance sheet relative 
to our current agreement with Fannie.  Fannie has made it very clear to us that we should 
not expect to retain the same pricing and credit parameters for Option ARMs in our 2005 
pricing agreement that we have enjoyed during 2004.  For fixed rate loans and hybrids, g-
fe[e]s adjusted for MAP Pricing and credit parameters are roughly equivalent to the 
Fannie Agreement.”502

In April 2004, at the conclusion of its negotiations with Fannie and Freddie, WaMu 
entered into a one-year contract with Freddie Mac, switching the lion’s share of the bank’s 
conforming loans to that company and away from Fannie Mae.503  According to WaMu, Freddie 
Mac’s share of its conforming loans “went from 20% in Q1 [first quarter of 2005] to 81% in Q2 
[second quarter of 2005].”504  WaMu reported internally that, as a result of the new contract, it 
became the second largest seller of mortgages to Freddie Mac behind Wells Fargo, and that 
“[f]orty percent of FRE’s [Freddie Mac’s] portfolio growth in ’05 can be attributed to WM’s $8 
billion sale of option ARMS.”505

   

 
As the 2005 contract’s expiration date neared, WaMu developed a list of issues to be 

negotiated with Freddie Mac for a new contract, noting that Freddie Mac “does not want to be a 
‘one-year’ wonder.”506  WaMu also observed that “FRE is not likely to outbid FNM by such a 
wide margin on option ARMS like in the current contract.”507
relationship” with Freddie Mac, WaMu indicated, among other issues, that it would press 
Freddie Mac to buy more subprime and “lower quality loans”: 

  In a list of “asks … to cement our 

 
  “Credit … 

  Non-prime 

•  WM [WaMu] wants FRE [Freddie Mac] to expand the eligibility of lower 

quality loans to ensure WM is ‘market competitive’.  … 

•  Potential securitization of SMF [Specialty Mortgage Finance] assets ($1.5 - 
$10 bil) that will create liquidity for WM and create a positive affordability 
profile for FRE;  

•  Expansion of credit profile into subprime; (Keith Johnson wants to keep this 

point very general); … 

  Liquidity – we want to understand how we can best help the FRE portfolio 

w/Product. 

 

•  Longer term portfolio commitment on option ARMS; 
•  Broader deliverability guidelines w/respect to option ARMs.”508

 

 

WaMu wrote that it also expected Freddie Mac to discuss trends related to accepting “lower 
documentation standards.”509

 
In April 2006, WaMu signed a new, two-year contract with Freddie Mac, again agreeing 
  WaMu President Steve Rotella 

to sell the majority of its conforming loans to that company.510

WaMu’s reference to the “stronger GSE” was in response to accounting scandals that, 
over the prior year, had weakened both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.  In 2003, Freddie Mac 
announced that it had misstated its earnings by at least $4.5 billion, mostly by under-reporting its 
earnings in order to smooth the volatility of its quarterly earnings reports, and would be restating 
its earnings for the prior three years.

that Fannie Mae had also violated accounting rules to smooth its earnings reports.515  Fannie Mae 
later filed a $6.3 billion restatement of earnings and paid a $400 million fine.516
  Both GSEs also 
changed their senior management.

When asked at the Subcommittee hearing to define Washington Mutual’s relationship 

with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Mr. Rotella provided the following response: 

“Well, like all big mortgage lenders, Senator, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were 
important ....  [T]here was a substantial amount of production that was sold off to either 
Fannie or Freddie. ...  [A]ny mortgage lender that is in the mortgage business, given the

Loan Sales to Fannie and Freddie.  During the years examined by the Subcommittee, 

WaMu sold a variety of loans to both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including 15, 20, and 30-
year fixed rate mortgages; Option ARMs; interest-only ARMs; and hybrid ARMs.518

  

141 

 
A September 2005 chart prepared by WaMu, identifying the loans it sold to Fannie Mae 

and Freddie Mac during the first part of that year, details the types and volumes of loans 
involved.519  The chart showed, for example, that the largest category of loans that WaMu sold to 
Fannie and Freddie at that point in 2005 was fixed rate loans, which together totaled nearly 
140,000 loans with a collective, total loan amount of about $24.3 billion.520  The next largest 
category of loans was Option ARMs, which WaMu sold only to Freddie Mac and which 
consisted of 35,421 loans with a total loan amount of about $7.9 billion.521  The third largest 
category was interest-only ARMs, totaling about 8,400 loans with a total loan amount of about 
$2 billion.522  The fourth largest category was hybrid ARMs, totaling 6,500 loans with a total 
loan amount of about $1.4 billion.523   WaMu also sold other loans to Fannie and Freddie which 
included 6,020 loans of various types bearing a total loan amount of about $2 billion.524
 

   

The chart showed that, altogether by September 2005, WaMu had sold Fannie and 

Freddie about 196,000 loans with a total loan amount of $36.5 billion.525 About 70% were fixed 
rate loans;526 about 20% were Option ARMs;527 and other types of loans made up the final 10%.  
In addition to those single family mortgages, WaMu had an active business with Fannie and 
Freddie regarding loans related to multifamily apartment buildings.528  The 2005 loan data 
indicates that WaMu sold twice as many loans to Fannie and Freddie as it did to all other buyers 
combined.529
  Most of those loans were fixed rate mortgages, but they also included the higher

4/16-91 (chart entitled, “WaMu’s Deliveries – Contract to Date 2005”).  For more information on these types of 
loans, see Chapter II, above.  WaMu did not sell loans directly to Ginnie Mae which, instead, guaranteed certain 
government backed mortgages when they were securitized by one of its approved securitizers.  The WaMu chart 
showed that, in 2005, WaMu originated 35,291 loans with a total loan amount of about $4.6 billion that were 
securitized with Ginnie Mae guarantees.  Id.

Freddie Mac than to all of its other buyers combined.530

 
The amount and variety of the loans that WaMu sold to the GSEs fluctuated over time.  

 
For example, the following chart, which is taken from data compiled by Inside Mortgage 
Finance, presents the total dollar volume of loans sold by WaMu to Fannie and Freddie from 
2000 until 2008 when WaMu was sold, as well as the percentage those loans represented 
compared to WaMu’s total loan originations.531

The data indicates that, in total, WaMu sold more than half a trillion dollars in loans to the two 
GSEs in the nine years leading up to the bank’s collapse, accounting for more than a quarter of 
all of the loans WaMu originated.   
 
 
The documents obtained by the Subcommittee indicate that, from 2004 to 2008, Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac competed to purchase billions of dollars in WaMu’s residential mortgage 
loans, and WaMu used that competition to negotiate better terms for its loan sales.  Twice during 
that period, WaMu successfully played one GSE off the other to sell more high risk Option 
ARM loans under better terms to Freddie Mac.   
                                                                                                                                                             
Freddie.  The two largest categories of loans sold to buyers other than Fannie or Freddie were jumbo loans (43,758 
loans with a total loan amount of $26.9 billion) and government backed loans in securities guaranteed by Ginnie 
Mae (35,291 loans with a total loan amount of $4.6 billion).  Id.   
530 Id.  The chart indicates that WaMu sold over 17,000 loans with a total loan amount of nearly $4 billion to Freddie 
Mac, but only 5,841 Option ARMs with a total loan amount of $1.2 billion to all other buyers.  It is possible, 
however, that the data on Option ARMs sold to other buyers is understated if some portion of the loans categorized 
on the chart as “jumbo” loans were, in fact, also Option ARMs.  See, e.g., Id. at JPM_WM02575611, Hearing 
Exhibit 4/16-91 (interpretive note below chart); 8/2006 WaMu chart entitled, “WaMu Originations Product Mix,” at 
JPM_WM00212644, Hearing Exhibit 4/13-37 (showing that WaMu used Option ARMs in both conforming and 
jumbo loans).  In addition to selling Option ARMs to Freddie Mac and others, WaMu kept a portion of the Option 
ARMs it originated in its investment portfolio and securitized still others.

F.  Destructive Compensation Practices 

143 

 
 
 

Washington Mutual and Long Beach’s compensation practices contributed to and 

deepened its high risk lending practices.  Loan officers and processors were paid primarily on 
volume, not primarily on the quality of their loans, and were paid more for issuing higher risk 
loans.  Loan officers and mortgage brokers were also paid more when they got borrowers to pay 
higher interest rates, even if the borrower qualified for a lower rate – a practice that enriched 
WaMu in the short term, but made defaults more likely down the road.  Troubling compensation 
practices went right to the top.  In 2008, when he was asked to leave the bank that failed under 
his management, CEO Kerry Killinger received a severance payment of $15 million.532
 

 

 

(1) Sales Culture  
 
WaMu’s compensation policies were rooted in the bank culture that put loan sales ahead 

 
 
of loan quality.  As early as 2004, OTS expressed concern about WaMu’s sales culture:  “The 
overt causes for past underwriting concerns were many, but included:  (1) A sales culture 
focused heavily on market share via loan production, (2) extremely high lending volumes.”533  In 
early 2005, WaMu’s Chief Credit Officer complained to Mr. Rotella that: “[a]ny attempts to 
enforce [a] more disciplined underwriting approach were continuously thwarted by an 
aggressive, and often times abusive group of Sales employees within the organization.”534  The 
aggressiveness of the sales team toward underwriters was, in his words, “infectious and 
dangerous.”535

 

 
In late 2006, as home mortgage delinquency rates began to accelerate and threaten the 

viability of WaMu’s High Risk Lending Strategy, Home Loans President David Schneider 
presided over a “town hall” meeting to rally thousands of Seattle based employees of the WaMu 
Home Loans Group.536
  At the meeting, Mr. Schneider made a presentation, not just to WaMu’s 
sales force, but also to the thousands of risk management, finance, and technology staff in

email to her staff quotes Mr. Schneider’s language from this presentation. 1/3/2007 email from Ron Cathcart to

demonstrates the importance and pervasiveness of the sales culture at WaMu:539

 

144 

 

 

 

 
When asked about this presentation, Mr. Schneider told the Subcommittee it was an appropriate 
message, even for WaMu’s risk managers.540

 

 
The sales culture was also promoted through WaMu’s “President’s Club,” which 

sponsored an annual all-expense-paid gala and retreat in an exotic locale, such as Hawaii or the 
Bahamas, where the top producing loan officers were feted and lavished with gifts and 
plaudits.541
  Only a limited number of top producing loan officers were made members of the 
club, and the President’s Club trips were used to incentivize sales volume.  Loan officers were 
encouraged to look up their sales rankings on the company’s intranet to see if they would qualify 
for a trip.   

 
In November 2006, as subprime mortgages began to incur delinquencies, Mr. Schneider 
sent a letter about the President’s Club to WaMu loan consultants.  Under a photo of the Grand 
Hyatt Kauai in Hawaii and the banner headline, “President’s Club – Take the Lead!,” Mr. 
Schneider wrote:

“I attended WaMu’s President’s Club last year for the first time and had an awesome 
time getting to know the stars of our sales force.  You work hard, but you know how to 
have a good time too …. 

“At the first-class awards dinner, I looked around the room and felt honored to be with so 
many talented people.  Congratulations to those of you who were repeat President’s Club 
honorees.  Of those of you who have not yet reached the President’s Club, I want each 
and every one of you to believe you have the potential to achieve this great reward. 
“Now is the time to really kick it into high gear and drive for attending this awesome 
event!  Rankings are updated and posted monthly on the DashBoards (under reports) and 
on WaMu.net: President’s Club Rankings.  Where do you rank?  What can you do to take 
your business [to] the next level?  Your management team is here to help.”542
 
At the April 13 Subcommittee hearing, Mr. Schneider testified: 

 

 

 
 

 

 

“As housing prices peaked, the economy softened, and credit markets tightened, WaMu 
adopted increasingly conservative credit policies and moved away from loan products 
with greater credit risk.  ...  During my time at WaMu, we reduced and then entirely 
stopped making Alt A loans and Option ARM loans.”543

 

 
However, his November 2006 letter to WaMu loan consultants showed no reticence about the 
High Risk Lending Strategy.  The letter went on to say: 
 

“As you know, growth is a key area of focus for WaMu and Home Loans.  I am 
extremely proud of the achievements in Production so far this year – and I know it’s been 
tough.  I’m especially pleased with your ability to change with the market and 
responsibly sell more higher-margin products – Option ARM, Home Equity, Non-prime, 
and Alt A.  I also know that you – truly the best sales team in the industry – are up to the 
challenge of doing even more by year end.  ... 

“I hope to see you in Kauai!”544
 
The 2005 President’s Club retreat had taken place in Maui.  The awards night was hosted 

 

by Magic Johnson.  An excerpt of the script from the evening gives a sense of the proceedings:

WALK-UP MUSIC 
FOR DAVID SCHNEIDER 
 

146 

DAVID SCHNEIDER 

Thank you ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this very special Awards 
Evening. 
 
Wow, could you feel the energy and excitement tonight out on the Red Carpet?!  
Talk about star power! 
 
And it was great fun to learn so much more about some of you during the 
interviews … and at the bar. 
 
But don’t worry.  I’m told that the age-old tradition here at Washington Mutual is, 
‘What happens at President’s Club stays at President’s Club.’  And who am I to 
mess with tradition? 
 
Tonight we are gathered together to pay the highest respects and honors to those 
who deserve them the most, the President’s Club Class of 2005.  … 
 
And of course I want to pay special homage to all of you astonishing returning 
champions of President’s Club.  You multiple award-winning superstars clearly 
lead our entire industry as the standard others can only attempt to match.  You 
folks really do make this feel like the academy awards tonight because 
everywhere I turn I see another star of another box office sensation.”545
 

 

This 2005 awards ceremony was attended by WaMu loan officers Luis Fragoso and Thomas 
Ramirez at the same time they were under investigation for fraud.  Both were members of the 
President’s Club in 2005 and 2006. 
 
 
When asked about the sales culture at the bank, Mr. Vanasek testified at the hearing that 
he tried in vain to counter it.  He recalled one occasion at an annual management retreat in 2004, 
in which the bank was promoting a new advertising slogan called, “The Power of Yes”: 
 

“I stood in front of thousands of senior Washington Mutual managers and executives in 
an annual management retreat in 2004 and countered the senior executive ahead of me on 
the program who was rallying the troops with the company's advertising line, ‘The power 
of yes.’  The implication of that statement was that Washington Mutual would find some 
way to make a loan.  The tag line symbolized the management attitude about mortgage 
lending more clearly than anything I can tell you.

“Because I believed this sent the wrong message to the loan originators, I felt compelled 
to counter the prior speaker by saying to the thousands present that the power of yes 
absolutely needed to be balanced by the wisdom of no.  This was highly unusual for a 
member of the management team to do, especially in such a forum.  In fact, it was so far 
out of the norm for meetings of this type that many considered my statement exceedingly 
risky from a career perspective.”546
 
The President’s Club annual trip was the pinnacle of WaMu awards to its top producing 

 

loan consultants.  One loan consultant interviewed by the Subcommittee described it as an 
incredible experience, with first class airfare, daily gifts, lavish food, and top entertainment for 
both employees and their spouses.547
including Mr. Killinger, Mr. Rotella, and Mr. Schneider.  It sent a powerful message about the 
priority that WaMu placed on loan volume and sales of higher risk loans. 

  It was also an opportunity to meet WaMu’s top executives, 

 
(2) Paying for Speed and Volume 

 
 
 
The Long Beach and Washington Mutual compensation systems encouraged high 
volumes of risky loans but provided little or no incentive to ensure high quality loans that 
complied with the bank’s credit requirements.  WaMu loan officers or their sales associates 
typically interacted directly with customers interested in obtaining loans.  Some also were 
allowed to accept loans brought to them by third party lenders or mortgage brokers.  Long Beach 
account executives dealt only with third party lenders or mortgage brokers; they did not deal 
directly with customers.  After reaching agreement on a loan, the WaMu or Long Beach loan 
officers or executives completed the loan application and sent it to a loan processing center 
where the application was reviewed by an underwriter and, if approved, underwent further 
processing and brought to a loan closing. 
 

Long Beach and Washington Mutual loan officers received more money per loan for 

originating higher risk loans and for exceeding established loan targets.  Loan processing 
personnel were compensated according to the speed and number of the loans they processed.  
Loan officers and their sales associates received still more compensation if they charged 
borrowers higher interest rates or points than required in bank rate sheets specifying loan prices, 
or included prepayment penalties in the loan agreements.  That added compensation created 
incentives to increase loan profitability, but not loan quality.  A 2008 OTS review elaborated:  
 

“[T]he review defines an origination culture focused more heavily on production volume 
rather than quality.  An example of this was a finding that production personnel were 
allowed to participate in aspects of the income, employment, or asset verification process, 
a clear conflict of interest. …   Prior OTS examinations have raised similar issues

148 

 

Despite the years of internal and external audits that found a lack of internal controls at 

including the need to implement incentive compensation programs to place greater 
emphasis on loan quality.”548
 
(a) Long Beach Account Executives 

 
 
 
 
Long Beach that led to some of the worst rates of loan delinquency in the subprime industry, 
Long Beach continued to incentivize production volume over sound lending.  The Subcommittee 
obtained a presentation of the Long Beach 2004 Incentive Plan.549  The plan outlines four 
compensation tiers based on volume, creating a system where the largest producers not only 
make more money by issuing more loans, but rather, as producers climb more of the tiers, they 
earn a higher rate of commission as well.  Tier 1 Long Beach account executives, those who 
closed 1-6 loans or funded up to $899,000 in loans per month, received 40 basis points (bps) 
commission for each broker sourced loan.550  Tier 2 Long Beach account executives, those who 
closed 7-12 loans or funded between $900,000 and $2,499,999 in loans per month, received 50 
bps commission for each broker sourced loan plus $30 per loan in additional compensation.  Tier 
3 Long Beach account executives, those who closed 13-26 loans or funded between $2,500,000 
and $4,999,999 in loans per month, received 55 bps commission for each broker sourced loan 
plus $30 additional per loan.  Tier 4 Long Beach account executives, those who closed more than 
26 loans or funded more than $5,000,000 in loans per month, received 60 bps commission for 
each broker sourced loan.551
 
 
called, “Long Term Cash Incentive Program,” which provided bonuses tied to the performance 
of WaMu stock and could be converted to cash over a three-year period.  Top producing Long 
Beach account executives received the Long Term Cash Incentive bonus calculated as a small 
percentage of overall volume.  Like the tier system, as volume increased so did the percentage 
used to calculate the bonus.  Account executives ranked in the top 25% in volume received a five 
bps bonus on their total production, account executives in the top 15% received a 7.5 bps bonus, 
and account executives in the top 5% received a 10 bps bonus.  These bonuses could add up to 
tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.552
 
 
In addition, in 2004, the top 40 Long Beach account executives were rewarded with a trip 
to the President’s Club.  Long Beach used a point system to calculate the top account executives 
for this purpose.  Three points were awarded for each loan funded for first mortgages, two points

550 Id.  The “units” referred to in the document are “loans.”  Subcommittee interview of Brian Minkow (2/16/2010).  
By awarding “basis points” the compensation system ensured that the account executives got a percentage of the 
loan amounts that they successfully issued after receiving loan information from a broker, incentivizing them to 
maximize the dollar amount of the loans they issued.  Some were also paid a per loan fee, incentivizing them to sell 
as many loans as possible.

The 2004 Long Beach Incentive Plan also introduced a contingent compensation program 

 

 

149 

 
were awarded for each purchase loan funded (as opposed to a refinance), and two points were 
awarded for each $100,000 funded.  The point system created a competition that focused 
primarily on volume.  The 2004 incentive plan makes no reference to loan quality.553
 
 
Long Beach regularly made changes to the compensation plan, but the basic volume 
incentives remained.  In the 2007 incentive plan, which took effect after the collapse of the 
subprime market, the volume requirements were even greater than 2004 requirements.   In 2007, 
the Tier 1 represented 1-9 qualified loans and up to $1,499,999 funded; Tier 2 was 10-13 
qualified loans and between $1,500,000 and $2,399,000 funded; Tier 3 was 14-35 qualified loans 
and between $2,400,000 and $5,999,999 funded; Tier 4 was 36 or more loans and $6,000,000 or 
more funded.554
 
 

(b) WaMu Loan Consultants 
 
Like Long Beach, at WaMu loan officers were compensated for the volume of loans 

 

 

closed and loan processors were compensated for speed of loan closing rather than a more 
balanced scorecard of timeliness and loan quality.  According to the findings and 
recommendations from an April 2008 internal investigation into allegations of loan fraud at 
WaMu: 
 
“A design weakness here is that the loan consultants are allowed to 
communicate minimal loan requirements and obtain various verification 
documents from the borrower that [are] need[ed] to prove income, 
employment and assets.  Since the loan consultant is also more intimately 
familiar with our documentation requirements and approval criteria, the 
temptation to advise the borrower on means and methods to game the 
system may occur.  Our compensation and reward structure is heavily 
tilted for these employees toward production of closed loans.”555

 

 

An undated presentation obtained by the Subcommittee entitled, “Home Loans Product 

Strategy, Strategy and Business Initiatives Update,” outlines WaMu’s 2007 Home Loans 
Strategy and shows the decisive role that compensation played, while providing still more 
evidence of WaMu’s efforts to execute its High Risk Lending Strategy:

-Driving growth in higher margin products (Option ARM, Alt A, Home 
Equity, Subprime) …

In order to promote high risk, high margin products, WaMu paid its loan consultants 

 
The presentation goes on to explain the Retail Loan Consultant incentive plan:  “Incentive Tiers 
reward high margin products … such as the Option ARM, Non-Prime referrals and Home Equity 
Loans ….  WaMu also provides a 15 bps ‘kicker’ for selling 3 year prepayment penalties.”557
 
 
more to sell them.  WaMu divided its products into four categories: “W,” “A,” “M,” and “U.”  
WaMu paid the highest commissions for “W” category products, and in general, commissions 
decreased though the other categories.  “W” products included new Option ARMs, “Non-prime” 
referrals, and home equity loans.  “A” products included Option ARM refinancings, new hybrid 
ARMs, new Alt A loans, and new fixed rate loans.  Like Long Beach, WaMu also created four 
compensation tiers with increasing commissions based on volume.  The tiers were called: 
“Bronze,” “Silver,” “Gold,” and “Platinum.”558
continued to incentivize volume and high risk mortgage products. 

  Even in 2007, WaMu’s compensation plan 

 

 
In 2007, WaMu also adopted a plan to pay “overages,” essentially a payment to loan 
officers who managed to sell mortgages to clients with higher rates of interest than the clients 
qualified for or were called for in WaMu’s daily rate sheets.  The plan stated:   

 
“Overages …  [give a] Loan Consultant [the] [a]bility to increase compensation [and] 
[e]nhance compensation/incentive for Sales Management …. Major national competitors 
have a similar plan in place in the market. ”559
 

   

 

Under the 2007 plan, if a loan officer sold a loan that charged a higher rate of interest than 
WaMu would have accepted according to its rate sheet, WaMu would split the additional profit 
with the loan officer.560  This compensation practice, often referred to as awarding “yield spread 
premiums,” has been barred by the Dodd-Frank Act implementing financial reforms.561

(c) Loan Processors and Quality Assurance Controllers 

151 

At Long Beach and WaMu, volume incentives were not limited to the sales people.  Back 

 
 
 
 
office loan processors and quality control personnel were also compensated for volume.  While 
WaMu executives and senior managers told the Subcommittee that quality control was 
emphasized and considered as part of employee compensation, the back office staff said 
otherwise.562  Diane Kosch worked as a Quality Assurance Controller in a Long Beach Loan 
Fulfillment Center (LFC) in Dublin, California, east of San Francisco Bay.  She told the 
Subcommittee that the pressure to keep up with the loan volume was enormous.  Each month the 
LFC would set volume goals, measured in dollar value and the number of loans funded.  At the 
end of each month the pressure to meet those goals intensified.  Ms. Kosch said that at month’s 
end, she sometimes worked from 6 a.m. until midnight reviewing loan files.  Monthly rallies 
were held, and prizes were awarded to the underwriters and loan processors who had funded the 
most loans.563
 
 
September 2004 email sent to all Dublin LFC employees with the subject line, “Daily 
Productivity – Dublin,” by the area manager uses creative formatting to express enthusiasm: 
 

Documents obtained by the Subcommittee confirm Ms. Kosch’s recollections.  A 

 

“Less than 1 week and we have a long way to go to hit our 440M!  
including today, we have 4 days of fundings to end the Quarter with a 
bang!  With all the new UW changes, we will be swamped next month, so 
don’t hold any back! 
 
4 days…..it’s time for the mad dash to the finish line!  Who is in the 
running…… 
 
Loan Set Up – Phuong is pulling away with another 18 files set up 
yesterday for 275 MTD!  2nd place is held by Jean with 243…can you

Ms. Kosch told the Subcommittee that from late 2005 until early 2007, loan volume 

increased and loan quality remained very poor.  She said that just about every loan she reviewed 
was a stated income loan, sloppy, or appeared potentially fraudulent.  Yet she was not given the 
resources or support to properly review each loan.  Ms. Kosch said that she was told by a Quality 
Control manager that she should spend 15 minutes on each file, which she felt was insufficient.  
Yet, because Quality Assurance Controllers received a bonus on the basis of the number of loans 
they reviewed, she said some of her colleagues spent only ten minutes on each file.565
 
 
Ms. Kosch found that often, when she tried to stop the approval of a loan that did not 
meet quality standards, it would be referred to management and approved anyway.  She said 
good Quality Assurance Controllers were treated like “black sheep,” and hated because they got 
in the way of volume bonuses.  She said certain brokers were identified as “elite,” and the Dublin 
LFC employees were told to, “take care of them.”  Ms. Kosch even suspected some underwriters 
were getting kickbacks, in part, because of the clothes they wore and cars they drove, which she 
believed would have been unaffordable to even the top back office employees.  She reported her 
suspicions to her supervisor, but she was not aware of any action taken as a result. 
 
 
As it turns out, Ms. Kosch’s concerns about fraud were not unfounded.  The September 
2004 Daily Productivity email also lauds the work of a Senior Loan Coordinator (SLC) named 
John Ngo:  
 

 

“SLC – This one is still tight with Sandy holding on to the first place slot!  Sandy 
funded 4 more on Friday for a MTD total of 46!  2nd place is John Ngo with 4 fundings 
on Friday and 44 MTD – only 2 back!”   
 

About a year after this email was sent, the FBI began to question Mr. Ngo about a scheme to buy 
houses in Stockton, California with fake documents and stolen identities.  According to court 
records, the FBI had uncovered documents that showed Mr. Ngo had received more than 
$100,000 in payments from a mortgage broker, allegedly bribes to approve bad loans.  Mr. Ngo’s 
estranged wife told the FBI that she didn’t know how he could afford their $1.4 million home for 
which he made a down payment of $350,000.   At the time, his salary at Long Beach was 
$54,000. 566
 
 
Mr. Ngo later pled guilty to perjury and agreed to testify against his Long Beach sales 
associate, Joel Blanford.  Long Beach paid Mr. Blanford more than $1 million in commissions 
each year from 2003-2005.  According to the Department of Justice: 
 

 

“NGO admitted in his plea agreement that most of the payments were to ensure that 
fraudulent loan applications were processed and funded.  NGO also admitted he received 
payments from Long Beach Mortgage sales representatives to push applications through 
the funding process.  He knew many of these applications were fraudulent, and he and

others took steps to ‘fix’ applications by creating false documents or adding false 
information to the applications or the loan file.”567

 

(3) WaMu Executive Compensation 

 
 
 
 
Questionable compensation practices did not stop in the loan offices, but went all the way 
to the top of the company.  WaMu’s CEO received millions of dollars in pay, even when his high 
risk loan strategy began unraveling, even when the bank began to falter, and even when he was 
asked to leave his post.  From 2003 to 2007, Mr. Killinger was paid between $11 million and $20 
million each year in cash, stock, and stock options.  In addition, WaMu provided him with four 
retirement plans, a deferred bonus plan, and a separate deferred compensation plan.  In 2008, 
when he was asked to leave to leave the bank, Mr. Killinger was paid $25 million, including $15 
million in severance pay.  Altogether, from 2003 to 2008, Washington Mutual paid Mr. Killinger 
nearly $100 million, on top of multi-million-dollar corporate retirement benefits.568
 
 
As WaMu began losing billions of dollars due to the declining value of its loans and 
mortgage backed securities, top management paid significant attention to ensuring that they 
would be well compensated despite the crisis.  In January 2008, Mr. Killinger sent Mr. Rotella an 
email with the subject “comp,” seeking input on formulating compensation recommendations for 
the Board of Directors’ Human Resources Committee.  The email discussed compensation for 
WaMu’s top executives.  Mr Killinger wrote:  “Our current thinking is to recommend that equity 
grants be in options this year. …  I am considering an additional restricted stock grant which 
would help a bit on retention and to help offset the low bonus for 2007.” 569
 
 
bonuses in cash: 
 

Mr. Rotella responded that he thought WaMu executives would want more of their 

 

 

“[T]he feeling people will have about this is tied to the level of pain on the cash bonus 
side ….  Unfortunately more than a few feel that our stock price will not easily recover, 
that it is highly dependent on housing and credit and they can’t influence that at all.  This 
will come on the heels of what will be a terrible fourth qtr, and likely very poor results in 
the first half along with continued bad news in the environment.  So we will have some 
people thinking, ‘this is nice but I don’t see the upside in a time frame that works.’  Also, 
as you know folks feel very burned by the way their paper was tied to performance 
targets that they now see as unrealistic and tied to housing and have a jaundiced view of 
paper. …  People want more certainty now with some leverage, not a high dose of 
leverage with low cash.”570

Mr. Killinger replied:  “In short, the success of the comp program is up to you and me.  I think 
we are putting the right economics and opportunities on the table.  But we have to convince our 
folks that they will all make a lot of money by being with WaMu.”571
 
 
In February 2008, the Human Resources Committee approved a bonus plan for executive 
officers that tried to shield the executive bonuses from any impact caused by WaMu’s mounting 
mortgage losses.  The Committee established a formula consisting of four weighted performance 
measures, but took steps to exclude mortgage losses.  The first performance measure, for 
example, set a goal for WaMu’s 2008 net operating profit, but adjusted the profit calculation to 
exclude:  “(i) loan loss provisions other than related to our credit card business and (ii) expenses 
related to foreclosed real estate assets.”572  The second performance measure set a target limiting 
WaMu’s 2008 noninterest expense, but excluded expenses related to:  “(i) business resizing or 
restructuring and (ii) foreclosed real estate assets.”573
 
 
mortgage related losses and expenses in the plan attracted notice from shareholders and the 
press.  One March 5, 2008 article entitled, “WaMu Board Shields Executives’ Bonuses,” 
reported:  “The board of Washington Mutual Inc. has set compensation targets for top executives 
that will exclude some costs tied to mortgage losses and foreclosures when cash bonuses are 
calculated this year.”574  WaMu employees circulated the article through company email.575
  
Investors and analysts raised concerns. 
 
 
Mr. Killinger sought to respond to the controversy in a way that would placate investors 
without alienating executives.  His solution was to eliminate bonuses for the top five executives, 
and make cash payments to the other executives, without making that fact public.  In July, Mr. 
Killinger emailed Steve Frank, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, with his proposal: 
 

WaMu filed its executive compensation plan with the SEC, as required.  The exclusion of 

 

“We would like to have the HR [Human Resources] committee approve excluding the 
exec com [Executive Committee] from the 2008 bonus and to approve the cash retention 
grants to the non NEOs [Named Executive Officers].  This would allow me to respond to 
questions next week regarding the bonus plan on the analyst call.  And it would help calm 
down some of the EC [Executive Committee] members.”576

 

 

In other words, WaMu would announce publicly that none of the Executive Committee members 
would receive bonuses in 2008, while quietly paying “retention grants” rather than “bonuses” to 
the next tier of executives.  Mr. Frank replied, “Sounds OK to me.”  Mr. Killinger followed up 
with the explanation:  “We would disclose the exclusion of EC [Executive Committee] members 
from the bonus plan.  There would be no disclosure of the retention cash payments.  Option

grants would be held off until whenever other comp. actions were done.”577  At WaMu’s annual 
meeting with shareholders, the Board indicated that it had “reversed” the decision to exclude 
mortgage losses when calculating executive bonuses and made no mention of the cash retention 
payments planned for some executives.578
 
When WaMu failed, shareholders lost all of their investments.  Yet in the waning days of 
 
the company, top executives were still well taken care of.  On September 8, 2008, Mr. Killinger 
walked away with $25 million, including $15 million in severance pay.  His replacement, Allen 
Fishman, received a $7.5 million signing bonus for taking over the reins from Mr. Killinger in 
September 2008.579  Eighteen days later, WaMu failed, and Mr. Fishman was out of a job.  
According to his contract, he was eligible for about $11 million in severance pay when the bank 
failed.580
 

  It is unclear how much of the severance he received. 

  G.  Preventing High Risk Lending  

Washington Mutual was a $300 billion, 120-year-old financial institution that was 
destroyed by high risk lending practices.  By 2007, stated income loans – loans in which 
Washington Mutual made no effort to verify the borrower’s income or assets – made up 50% of 
its subprime loans, 73% of its Option ARMs, and 90% of its home equity loans.  Nearly half of 
its loans were Option ARMs of which 95% of the borrowers were making minimum payments 
and 84% were negatively amortizing.  Numerous loans had loan-to-value ratios of over 80%, and 
some provided 100% financing.  Loans issued by two high volume loan offices in the Los 
Angeles area were found to have loan fraud rates of 58, 62, and even 83%.  Loan officer sales 
assistants were manufacturing borrower documentation.  The bank’s issuance of hundreds of 
billions of dollars in high risk, poor quality loans not only destroyed confidence in the bank, but 
also undermined the U.S. financial system.   

The consequences of WaMu’s High Risk Lending Strategy and the proliferation of its 
RMBS structured finance products incorporating high risk, poor quality loans provide critical 
lessons that need to be learned to protect the U.S. financial system from similar financial 
disasters.  A number of developments over the past two years hold promise in helping to address 
many of the problems identified in the Washington Mutual case history.

changes in law that will be implemented over the course of 2011.  The Dodd-Frank Act changes

include banning stated income loans; restricting negative amortization loans; requiring lenders to 
retain an interest in high risk loan pools that they sell or securitize; prohibiting lenders from 
steering borrowers to poor quality, high risk loans; and re-evaluating the role of high risk, 
structured finance products in bank portfolios. 

Ban on Stated Income Loans.  Multiple witnesses at the Subcommittee’s April 16, 2010 

 
hearing on the role of bank regulators expressed support for banning stated income loans.  The 
FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair testified:  “We are opposed to stated income. …  We think you 
should document income.”581  When asked for his opinion of stated income loans, the FDIC 
Inspector General Jon Rymer responded:  “I do not think they should be allowed,”582 stressing 
the fraud risk:  “I really can see no practical reason from a banker’s perspective or a lender’s 
perspective to encourage that.  … That is just, to me, an opportunity to essentially encourage 
fraud.” 583  Treasury Inspector General Eric Thorson also criticized stated income loans, 
explaining:  “[T]he problem is, you can’t assess the strength of the borrower and that has got to 
be at the foundation of underwriting, risk assessment, risk management.”584  Even the former 
head of OTS called stated income loans an “anathema” and expressed regret that OTS had 
allowed them.585

   

The Dodd-Frank Act essentially bans stated income loans by establishing minimum 
standards for residential mortgages in Title XIV of the law.   Section 1411 establishes a new 
Section 129C of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) prohibiting lenders from issuing a residential 
mortgage without first conducting a “good faith and reasonable” determination, based upon 
“verified and documented information,” that a borrower has a “reasonable ability to repay the 
loan” and all applicable taxes, insurance, and assessments.  Subsection 129C(a)(4) states the 
lender “shall verify” the borrower’s income and assets by reviewing the borrower’s W-2 tax 
form, tax returns, payroll receipts, financial institution records, or “other third-party documents 
that provide reasonably reliable evidence” of the borrower’s income or assets.  In addition, 
Section 1412 of the Dodd-Frank Act adds a new Subsection 129C(b) to TILA establishing a new 
category of “qualified mortgages” eligible for more favorable treatment under federal law.  It 
states that, in all “qualified mortgages,” the “income and financial resources” of the borrower 
must be “verified and documented.”  

These statutory requirements, by prohibiting lenders from issuing a residential mortgage 
without first verifying the borrower’s income and assets, essentially put an end to stated income 
loans.586

586 The Federal Reserve is charged with issuing regulations to implement Section 1411.  Federal Reserve regulations 
issued in July 2008, under the authority of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) of 1994, 
which took effect in October 2009, already require lenders issuing certain high cost mortgages to verify a borrower’s 
ability to repay the loan.  73 Fed. Reg. 147, at 44543 (7/30/2008).  Since the Dodd-Frank Act applies to all types of

Restrictions on Negative Amortization Loans.  Witnesses at the Subcommittee’s April 
16 hearing also criticized WaMu’s heavy reliance on Option ARM loans.  These loans provided 
borrowers with a low initial interest rate, which was followed at a later time by a higher variable 
rate.  Borrowers were generally qualified for the loans by assuming they would pay the lower 
rather than the higher rate.  In addition, borrowers were allowed to select one of four types of 
monthly payments, including a “minimum payment” that was less than the interest and principal 
owed on the loan.  If the borrower selected the minimum payment, the unpaid interest was added 
to the unpaid loan principal, which meant that the loan debt could increase rather than decrease 
over time, resulting in negative amortization.   

At the Subcommittee hearing, the FDIC Inspector General Jon Rymer warned that 

negative amortization loans are “extraordinarily risky” for both borrowers and banks.587
FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair testified:  

  The 

 
“We are opposed to teaser rate underwriting.  You need to underwrite at the fully indexed 
rate.  You should document the customer’s ability to repay, not just the initial 
introductory rate, but if it is an adjustable product, when it resets, as well.”588
   

The Dodd-Frank Act does not ban negatively amortizing loans, but does impose new 

restrictions on them.  Section 1411 amends TILA by adding a new Section 129C(6) that requires, 
for any residential mortgage that allows a borrower “to defer the repayment of any principal or 
interest,” that the lender vet potential borrowers based upon the borrower’s ability to make 
monthly loan payments on a fully amortizing schedule – meaning a schedule in which the loan 
would be fully repaid by the end of the loan period – instead of evaluating the borrower’s ability 
to make payments at an initial teaser rate or in some amount that is less than the amount required 
at a fully amortized rate.  The law also requires the lender, when qualifying a borrower, to “take 
into consideration any balance increase that may accrue from any negative amortization 
provision.”  This provision essentially codifies the provisions in the 2006 Nontraditional 
Mortgage Guidance regarding qualification of borrowers for negatively amortizing loans.  

In addition, Section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act adds a new Section 129C(c) to TILA 

prohibiting lenders from issuing a mortgage with negative amortization without providing certain 
disclosures to the borrower prior to the loan.  The lender is required to provide the borrower with 
an explanation of negative amortization in a manner prescribed by regulation as well as describe 
its impact, for example, how it can lead to an increase in the loan’s outstanding principal 
balance.  In the case of a first-time home buyer, the lender must also obtain documentation that 
the home buyer received homeownership counseling from a HUD-certified organization or 
counselor.  Finally, Section 1412 of the Dodd-Frank Act, establishing the new favored category 
of “qualified mortgages,” states those mortgages cannot negatively amortize. 

 

                                                                                                                                                             
mortgage loans, the Federal Reserve is expected to issue revised regulations during 2011, expanding the verification 
requirement to all mortgage loans.

Together, these borrower qualification and disclosure requirements, if well implemented, 

should reduce, although not eliminate, the issuance of negative amortization mortgages.   

 
Risk Retention.  One of the root causes of the financial crisis was the ability of lenders 
like Washington Mutual to securitize billions of dollars in high risk, poor quality loans, sell the 
resulting securities to investors, and then walk away from the risky loans it created.  At the April 
16 Subcommittee hearing, the FDIC Chairman Bair testified: 

“[W]e support legislation to require that issuers of mortgage securitizations retain some 
‘skin in the game’ to provide added discipline for underwriting quality.  In fact, the FDIC 
Board will consider … a proposal to require insured banks to retain a portion of the credit 
risk of any securitizations that they sponsor.”589
 
Section 941(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act adds a new section 15G to the Securities Exchange 

 

Act of 1934 to require the federal banking agencies, SEC, Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, and Federal Housing Finance Agency jointly to prescribe regulations to “require 
any securitizer to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk for any residential 
mortgage asset that the securitizer, through the issuance of an asset-backed security, transfers, 
sells, or conveys to a third party.”590
  The retained economic interest must be “not less than 5 
percent of the credit risk” of the assets backing the security, with an exception made for 
“qualified residential mortgages,” to be further defined by the regulators.  The regulators issued a 
proposed rule early in 2011, which is currently the subject of a public comment period. 

 
In the meantime, the FDIC has issued a new regulation, effective September 30, 2010, 

that imposes a range of disclosure, risk retention, and other obligations on all insured banks that 
issue asset backed securitizations.591
requirement on all asset backed securitizations issued by an insured bank, whether backed by 
mortgages or other assets.  The provision states that the bank sponsoring the securitization must: 

  One of the provisions imposes a 5% risk retention 

 
“retain an economic interest in a material portion, defined as not less than five (5) 
percent, of the credit risk of the financial assets. This retained interest may be either in 
the form of an interest of not less than five (5) percent in each of the credit tranches sold 
or transferred to the investors or in a representative sample of the securitized financial 
assets equal to not less than five (5) percent of the principal amount of the financial assets 
at transfer. This retained interest may not be sold or pledged or hedged, except for the 
hedging of interest rate or currency risk, during the term of the securitization.”592
 

 

The  provision  also  states  that  this  risk  retention  requirement  applies  only  until  the  “effective 
date” of the regulations to be issued under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act.

collateralized debt obligations.

The FDIC risk retention requirement, followed by the risk retention requirement to be 
developed under the Dodd-Frank Act, should, if well implemented, end the ability of banks to 
magnify risk through issuing asset backed securities and then walking away from that risk.  
Instead, banks will be required to keep “skin in the game” until each securitization concludes. 
 
Ban on Steering.  The Washington Mutual case history also exposed another problem:  
 
compensation incentives that encouraged loan officers and mortgage brokers to steer borrowers 
to higher risk loans.  Compensation incentives called “overages” at WaMu and “yield spread 
premiums” at other financial institutions also encouraged loan officers and mortgage brokers to 
charge borrowers higher interest rates and points than the bank would accept, so that the loan 
officer or mortgage banker could split the extra money taken from the borrower with the bank.   

 

 

 

To ban these compensation incentives, Section 1403 of the Dodd-Frank Act creates a new 

Section 129B(c) in TILA prohibiting the payment of any steering incentives, including yield 
spread premiums.  It states: “no mortgage originator shall receive from any person and no person 
shall pay to a mortgage originator, directly or indirectly, compensation that varies based on the 
terms of loan (other than the amount of the principal).”  It also states explicitly that no provision 
of the section should be construed as “permitting any yield spread premium or other similar 
compensation.”  In addition, it directs the Federal Reserve to issue regulations to prohibit a range 
of abusive and unfair mortgage related practices, including prohibiting lenders and brokers from 
steering borrowers to mortgages for which they lack a reasonable ability to repay.   

The Dodd-Frank provisions were enacted into law shortly before the Federal Reserve, in 
September 2010, promulgated new regulations prohibiting a number of unfair or abusive lending 
practices, including certain payments to mortgage originators.593  In its notice, the Federal 
Reserve noted that its new regulations prohibit many of the same practices banned in Section 
1403 of the Dodd Frank Act, but that it will fully implement the new Dodd-Frank measures in a 
future rulemaking.594

  

 
High Risk Loans.  Still another problem exposed by the Washington Mutual case history 

is the fact that, in the years leading up to the financial crisis, many U.S. insured banks held 
highly risky loans and securities in their investment and sale portfolios.  When those loans and 
securities lost value in 2007, many banks had to declare multi-billion-dollar losses that triggered 
shareholder flight and liquidity runs.   

Section 620 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking regulators, within 18 

months, to prepare a report identifying the activities and investments that insured banks and their 
affiliates are allowed to engage in under federal and state law, regulation, order, and guidance, 
and analyzing the risks associated with those activities and investments.  The federal banking 
agencies are also asked to make recommendations on whether each allowed activity or 
investment is appropriate, could negatively affect the safety and soundness of the banking entity 
or the U.S. financial system, and should be restricted to reduce risk.

(2)   Recommendations   
To further strengthen standards and controls needed to prevent high risk lending and 
safeguard the Deposit Insurance Fund, this Report makes the following recommendations. 

1.  Ensure “Qualified Mortgages” Are Low Risk.  Federal regulators should use their 
regulatory authority to ensure that all mortgages deemed to be “qualified residential 
mortgages” have a low risk of delinquency or default.  

2.  Require Meaningful Risk Retention.  Federal regulators should issue a strong risk 
retention requirement under Section 941 by requiring the retention of not less than a 
5% credit risk in each, or a representative sample of, an asset backed securitization’s 
tranches, and by barring a hedging offset for a reasonable but limited period of time. 

3.  Safeguard Against High Risk Products.  Federal banking regulators should 
safeguard taxpayer dollars by requiring banks with high risk structured finance 
products, including complex products with little or no reliable performance data, to 
meet conservative loss reserve, liquidity, and capital requirements. 

4.  Require Greater Reserves for Negative Amortization Loans.  Federal banking 
regulators should use their regulatory authority to require banks issuing negatively 
amortizing loans that allow borrowers to defer payments of interest and principal, to 
maintain more conservative loss, liquidity, and capital reserves.   

5.  Safeguard Bank Investment Portfolios.  Federal banking regulators should use the 
Section 620 banking activities study to identify high risk structured finance products 
and impose a reasonable limit on the amount of such high risk products that can be 
included in a bank’s investment portfolio.

IV.  REGULATORY FAILURE: 
 

CASE STUDY OF THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION    

Washington Mutual Bank (WaMu), with more than $300 billion in assets, $188 billion in 

deposits, over 2,300 branches in 15 states, and 43,000 employees, was by late 2008 the largest 
thrift under the supervision of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and among the eight 
largest financial institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  The 
bank’s collapse in September 2008 came on the heels of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy filing, 
accelerating the unraveling of the financial markets.  WaMu’s collapse marked one of the most 
spectacular failures of federal bank regulators in recent history. 

 
In 2007, many of WaMu’s home loans, especially those with the highest risk profile, 

began experiencing increased rates of delinquency, default, and loss.  After the subprime 
mortgage backed securities market collapsed in September 2007, Washington Mutual was unable 
to sell or securitize subprime loans and its loan portfolio began falling in value.  By the fourth 
quarter of 2007, the bank recorded a loss of $1 billion, and then in the first half of 2008, WaMu 
lost $4.2 billion more.  WaMu’s stock price plummeted against the backdrop of these losses and 
a worsening financial crisis elsewhere on Wall Street, which was witnessing the forced sales of 
Countrywide Financial Corporation and Bear Stearns, the government takeover of IndyMac, 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the taxpayer bailout of AIG, 
and the conversion of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley into bank holding companies.  From 
2007 to 2008, WaMu’s depositors withdrew a total of over $26 billion in deposits from the bank, 
triggering a liquidity crisis.  On September 25, 2008, OTS placed Washington Mutual Bank into 
receivership, and the FDIC, as receiver, immediately sold it to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion.  
Had the sale not gone through, Washington Mutual’s failure could have exhausted the FDIC’s 
entire $45 billion Deposit Insurance Fund.  

 
OTS records show that, during the five years prior to its collapse, OTS examiners 

repeatedly identified significant problems with Washington Mutual’s lending practices, risk 
management, and asset quality, and requested corrective action.  Year after year, WaMu 
promised to correct the identified problems, but failed to do so.  OTS, in turn, failed to respond 
with meaningful enforcement action, choosing instead to continue giving the bank inflated 
ratings for safety and soundness.  Until shortly before the thrift’s failure in 2008, OTS regularly 
gave WaMu a CAMELS rating of “2” out of “5,” which signaled to the bank and other regulators 
that WaMu was fundamentally sound.   

 
Federal bank regulators are charged with ensuring that U.S. financial institutions operate 
in a safe and sound manner.  However, in the years leading up to the financial crisis, OTS failed 
to prevent Washington Mutual’s increasing use of high risk lending practices and its origination 
and sale of tens of billions of dollars in poor quality home loans.  The agency’s failure to 
adequately monitor and regulate WaMu’s high risk lending stemmed in part from an OTS 
regulatory culture that viewed its thrifts as “constituents,” relied on them to correct the problems 
identified by OTS with minimal regulatory intervention, and expressed reluctance to interfere 
with even unsound lending and securitization practices.  OTS displayed an unusual amount of 

162 

deference to WaMu’s management, choosing to rely on the bank to police itself.  The reasoning 
appeared to be that if OTS examiners simply identified the problems at the bank, OTS could then 
rely on WaMu’s assurances that problems were corrected, with little need for tough enforcement 
actions.  It was a regulatory approach with disastrous results.  

Over the five-year period reviewed by the Subcommittee, OTS examiners identified over 
500 serious deficiencies in WaMu operations.  Yet OTS did not once, from 2004 to 2008, take a 
public enforcement action against Washington Mutual, even when the bank failed to correct 
major problems.  Only in late 2008, as the bank incurred mounting losses, did OTS finally take 
two informal, nonpublic enforcement actions, requiring WaMu to agree to a Board Resolution in 
March and a Memorandum of Understanding in September, but neither action was sufficient to 
prevent the bank’s failure.  OTS officials resisted calls by the FDIC, the bank’s backup regulator, 
for stronger measures and even impeded FDIC oversight efforts at the bank.  Hindered by a 
culture of deference to management, demoralized examiners, and agency infighting, OTS 
officials allowed the bank’s short term profits to excuse its risky practices and failed to evaluate 
the bank’s actions in the context of the U.S. financial system as a whole. 

OTS not only failed to prevent Washington Mutual from engaging in unsafe and unsound 
lending practices, it gave its tacit approval and allowed high risk loans to proliferate.  As long as 
Washington Mutual was able to sell off its risky loans, neither OTS nor the FDIC expressed 
concerns about the impact of those loans elsewhere.  By not sounding the alarm, OTS and the 
FDIC enabled WaMu to construct a multi-billion-dollar investment portfolio of high risk 
mortgage assets, and also permitted WaMu to sell hundreds of billions of dollars in high risk, 
poor quality loans and securities to other financial institutions and investors in the United States 
and around the world.  Similar regulatory failings by OTS, the FDIC, and other agencies 
involving other lenders repeated these problems on a broad scale.  The result was a mortgage 
market saturated with risky loans, and financial institutions that were supposed to hold 
predominantly safe investments but instead held portfolios rife with high risk, poor quality 
mortgages.  When those loans began defaulting in record numbers and mortgage related 
securities plummeted in value, financial institutions around the globe suffered hundreds of 
billions of dollars in losses, triggering an economic disaster.  The regulatory failures that set the 
stage for these losses were a proximate cause of the financial crisis. 

A.  Subcommittee Investigation and Findings of Fact 

To analyze regulatory oversight of Washington Mutual, the Subcommittee subpoenaed 

documents from OTS, the FDIC, and WaMu, including bank examination reports, legal 
pleadings, reports, internal memoranda, correspondence, and email.  The Subcommittee also 
conducted over two dozen interviews with OTS, FDIC, and WaMu personnel, including the 
FDIC Chairman, OTS Director, OTS and the FDIC senior examiners assigned to Washington 
Mutual, and senior WaMu executives.  The Subcommittee also spoke with personnel from the 
Offices of the Inspector General (IG) at the FDIC and the Department of Treasury, who were 
engaged in a joint review of WaMu’s failure.  In addition, the Subcommittee spoke with nearly a 
dozen experts on a variety of banking, accounting, regulatory, and legal issues.  On April 16, 
2010, the Subcommittee held a hearing at which OTS, the FDIC, and IG officials provided 

163 

testimony; released 92 hearing exhibits; and released the FDIC and Treasury IGs’ joint report on 
Washington Mutual.595

 

In connection with the hearing, the Subcommittee released a joint memorandum from 
Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Coburn summarizing the investigation to date into the 
role of the regulators overseeing WaMu.  That memorandum stated:  

“Federal bank regulators are supposed to ensure the safety and soundness of individual 
U.S. financial institutions and, by extension, the U.S. banking system.  Washington 
Mutual was just one of many financial institutions that federal banking regulators allowed 
to engage in such high risk home loan lending practices that they resulted in bank failure 
and damage to financial markets.  The ineffective role of bank regulators was a major 
contributor to the 2008 financial crisis that continues to afflict the U.S. and world 
economy today.” 

On March 16, 2011, the FDIC sued the three top former executives of Washington 

 
Mutual for pursuing a high risk lending strategy without sufficient risk management practices 
and despite their knowledge of a weakening housing market.596
  The FDIC complaint stated:  

“Chief Executive Officer Kerry K. Killinger (“Killinger”), Chief Operating 
Officer Stephen J. Rotella (“Rotella”), and Home Loans President David C. Schneider 
(“Schneider”) caused Washington Mutual Bank (“WaMu” or “the Bank”) to take extreme 
and historically unprecedented risks with WaMu’s held-for-investment home loans 
portfolio. They focused on short term gains to increase their own compensation, with 
reckless disregard for WaMu’s longer term safety and soundness. Their negligence, gross 
negligence and breaches of fiduciary duty caused WaMu to lose billions of dollars. The 
FDIC brings this Complaint to hold these three highly paid senior executives, who were 
chiefly responsible for WaMu’s higher risk home lending program, accountable for the 
resulting losses.”

164 

 
The Levin-Coburn memorandum contained joint findings of fact regarding the role of 
federal regulators in the Washington Mutual case history.  Those findings of fact, which this 
Report reaffirms, are as follows. 

1.  Largest U.S. Bank Failure.  From 2003 to 2008, OTS repeatedly identified 

significant problems with Washington Mutual’s lending practices, risk management, 
and asset quality, but failed to force adequate corrective action, resulting in the largest 
bank failure in U.S. history.   

 
2.  Shoddy Lending and Securitization Practices.  OTS allowed Washington Mutual 
and its affiliate Long Beach Mortgage Company to engage year after year in shoddy 
lending and securitization practices, failing to take enforcement action to stop its 
origination and sale of loans with fraudulent borrower information, appraisal 
problems, errors, and notoriously high rates of delinquency and loss. 

 
3.  Unsafe Option ARM Loans.  OTS allowed Washington Mutual to originate 
hundreds of billions of dollars in high risk Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages, 
knowing that the bank used unsafe and unsound teaser rates, qualified borrowers 
using unrealistically low loan payments, permitted borrowers to make minimum 
payments resulting in negatively amortizing loans (i.e., loans with increasing 
principal), relied on rising house prices and refinancing to avoid payment shock and 
loan defaults, and had no realistic data to calculate loan losses in markets with flat or 
declining house prices. 

 
4.  Short Term Profits Over Long Term Fundamentals.  OTS abdicated its 

responsibility to ensure the long term safety and soundness of Washington Mutual by 
concluding that short term profits obtained by the bank precluded enforcement action 
to stop the bank’s use of shoddy lending and securitization practices and unsafe and 
unsound loans. 

 
5.  Impeding FDIC Oversight.  OTS impeded FDIC oversight of Washington Mutual 

by blocking its access to bank data, refusing to allow it to participate in bank 
examinations, rejecting requests to review bank loan files, and resisting the FDIC 
recommendations for stronger enforcement action. 

 
6.  FDIC Shortfalls.  The FDIC, the backup regulator of Washington Mutual, was 

unable to conduct the analysis it wanted to evaluate the risk posed by the bank to the 
Deposit Insurance Fund, did not prevail against unreasonable actions taken by OTS to 
limit its examination authority, and did not initiate its own enforcement action against 
the bank in light of ongoing opposition by the primary federal bank regulators to 
FDIC enforcement authority. 

 
7.  Recommendations Over Enforceable Requirements.  Federal bank regulators 

undermined efforts to end unsafe and unsound mortgage practices at U.S. banks by 
issuing guidance instead of enforceable regulations limiting those practices, failing to 

165 

prohibit many high risk mortgage practices, and failing to set clear deadlines for bank 
compliance. 

 
8.  Failure to Recognize Systemic Risk.  OTS and the FDIC allowed Washington 

Mutual and Long Beach to reduce their own risk by selling hundreds of billions of 
dollars of high risk mortgage backed securities that polluted the financial system with 
poorly performing loans, undermined investor confidence in the secondary mortgage 
market, and contributed to massive credit rating downgrades, investor losses, 
disrupted markets, and the U.S. financial crisis.  

9.  Ineffective and Demoralized Regulatory Culture.  The Washington Mutual case 

history exposes the regulatory culture at OTS in which bank examiners are frustrated 
and demoralized by their inability to stop unsafe and unsound practices, in which 
their supervisors are reluctant to use formal enforcement actions even after years of 
serious bank deficiencies, and in which regulators treat the banks they oversee as 
constituents rather than arms-length regulated entities.  

 
B.  Background 

 

At the time of its collapse, Washington Mutual Savings Bank was a federally chartered thrift 
with over $188 billion in federal insured deposits.  Its primary federal regulator was OTS.  Due 
to its status as an insured depository institution, it was also overseen by the FDIC. 

(1)  Office of Thrift Supervision 

The Office of Thrift Supervision was created in 1989, in response to the savings and loan 
crisis, to charter and regulate the thrift industry.597  Thrifts are required by their charters to hold 
most of their assets in mortgage lending, and have traditionally focused on the issuance of home 
loans.598   OTS was part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and headed by a presidentially 
appointed director.  Like other bank regulators, OTS was charged with ensuring the safety and 
soundness of the financial institutions it oversaw.  Its operations were funded through 
semiannual fees assessed on the institutions it regulated, with the fee amount based on the size, 
condition, and complexity of each institution’s portfolio.  Washington Mutual was the largest 
thrift overseen by OTS and, from 2003 to 2008, paid at least $30 million in fees annually to the 
agency, which comprised 12-15% of all OTS revenue.599

   

                                                      
597 Twenty years after its establishment, OTS was abolished by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act, P.L. 111-203, (Dodd-Frank Act) which has transferred the agency’s responsibilities to the Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and directed the agency to cease all operations by 2012.  This Report 
focuses on OTS during the time period 2004 through 2008. 
598 6/19/2002 OTS Regulatory Bulletin, “Thrift Activities Regulatory Handbook Update” (some educational loans, 
SBLs, and credit card loans also count towards qualifying as a thrift), http://files.ots.treas.gov/74081.pdf.  
599 See April 16, 2010 Subcommittee Hearing at 11 (testimony of Treasury IG Eric Thorson). 

166 

In 2009, OTS oversaw about 765 thrift-chartered institutions.600

  OTS supervised its 
thrifts through four regional offices, each led by a Regional Director, Deputy Director, and 
Assistant Director.  Regional offices assigned an Examiner-in-Charge to each thrift in its 
jurisdiction, along with other supporting examination personnel.  Approximately three-quarters 
of the OTS workforce reported to its four regional offices, while the remaining quarter worked at 
OTS headquarters in Washington, D.C.  Washington Mutual, whose headquarters were located in 
Seattle, was supervised by the Western Region Office which, through the end of 2008, was based 
in Daly City, California.   

During the years reviewed by the Subcommittee, the OTS Executive Director was John 

Reich; the Deputy Director was Scott Polakoff; the Western Region Office Director was Michael 
Finn and later Darrel Dochow; and the Examiners-in-Charge at WaMu were Lawrence Carter 
and later Benjamin Franklin. 

(2)  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
WaMu’s secondary federal regulator was the FDIC.  The FDIC’s mission is to maintain 
stability and public confidence in the nation’s financial system by insuring deposits, examining 
and supervising financial institutions for safety and soundness and consumer protection, and 
managing failed institutions placed into receivership.601
  The FDIC administers the Deposit 
Insurance Fund, which is the primary mechanism used to protect covered deposits at U.S. 
financial institutions from loss.  The Deposit Insurance Fund is financed through fees assessed 
on the insured institutions, with assessments based on the amount of deposits requiring 
insurance, the amount of assets at each institution, and the degree of risk posed by each 
institution to the insurance fund. 

To minimize withdrawals from the Deposit Insurance Fund, the FDIC is assigned backup 

supervisory authority over approximately 3,000 federally insured depository institutions whose 
primary regulators are the Federal Reserve, OCC, and, until recently, OTS.  Among other 
measures, the FDIC is authorized to conduct a “special examination” of any insured institution 
“to determine the condition of such depository institution for insurance purposes.”
facilitate and coordinate its oversight obligations with those of the primary bank regulators and 
ensure it is able to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund, the FDIC has entered into an inter-agency 
agreement with the primary bank regulators.603
  The 2002 version of that agreement, which was 
in effect until 2010, stated that the FDIC was authorized to request to participate in examinations 
of large institutions or higher risk financial institutions, recommend enforcement actions to be 
taken by the primary regulator, and if the primary regulator failed to act, take its own 
enforcement action with respect to an insured institution.

602 12 U.S.C. § 1820(b)(3). 
603 The interagency agreement is entitled, “Coordination of Expanded Supervisory Information Sharing and Special 
Examinations.”  During the time period of the Subcommittee’s investigation, the 2002 version of the interagency 
agreement, signed by the FDIC, Federal Reserve, OCC, and OTS, was in effect.  In July 2010, the federal financial 
regulators agreed to adopt a stronger version, discussed later in this Report.  

167 

For the eight largest insured institutions at the time, the FDIC assigned at least one 

Dedicated Examiner to work on-site at the institution.  The examiner’s obligation is to evaluate 
the institution’s risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund and work with the primary regulator to lower 
that risk.  During the period covered by this Report, Washington Mutual was one of the eight and 
had an FDIC-assigned Dedicated Examiner who worked with OTS examiners to oversee the 
bank.  

During the years examined by the Subcommittee, the FDIC Chairman was Sheila Bair; 
the Acting Deputy Director for the FDIC’s Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection’s 
Complex Financial Institution Branch was John Corston; in the San Francisco Region, the 
Director was John Carter and later Stan Ivie, and the Assistant Director was George Doerr.  At 
WaMu, the FDIC’s Dedicated Examiner was Stephen Funaro. 

 
(3)  Examination Process   
The stated mission of OTS was “[t]o supervise savings associations and their holding 

companies in order to maintain their safety and soundness and compliance with consumer laws, 
and to encourage a competitive industry that meets America’s financial services needs.”  The 
OTS Examination Handbook required “[p]roactive regulatory supervision” with a focus on 
evaluation of “future needs and potential risks to ensure the success of the thrift system in the 
long term.”604
  OTS, like other bank regulators, had special access to the financial information of 
the thrifts under its regulation, which was otherwise kept confidential from the market and other 
parties.   

To carry out its mission, OTS traditionally conducted an examination of each of the 
thrifts within its jurisdiction every 12 to 18 months and provided the results in a Report of 
Examination (ROE).  In 2006, OTS initiated a “continuous exam” program for its largest thrifts, 
requiring its examiners to conduct a series of specialized examinations during the year with the 
results from all of those examinations included in an annual ROE.  The Examiner-in-Charge led 
the examination activities which were organized around the CAMELS rating system used by all 
federal bank regulators.  The CAMELS rating system evaluates a bank’s:  (C) capital adequacy, 
(A) asset quality, (M) management, (E) earnings, (L) liquidity, and (S) sensitivity to market risk.  
A CAMELS rating of 1 is the best rating, while 5 is the worst.  In the annual ROE, OTS 
provided its thrifts with an evaluation and rating for each CAMELS component, as well as an 
overall composite rating on the bank’s safety and soundness.

    

605

At Washington Mutual, OTS examiners conducted both on-site and off-site activities to 

review bank operations, and maintained frequent communication with bank management through 
emails, telephone conferences, and meetings.  During certain periods of the year, OTS examiners 
                                                      
604 2004 OTS Examination Handbook, Section 010.2, OTSWMEF-0000031969, Hearing Exhibit 4/16-2. 
605 A 1 composite rating in the CAMELS system means “sound in every respect”; a 2 rating means “fundamentally 
sound”; a 3 rating means “exhibits some degree of supervisory concern in one or more of the component areas”; a 4 
rating means “generally exhibits unsafe and unsound practices or conditions”; and a 5 rating means “exhibits 
extremely unsafe and unsound practices or conditions” and is of “greatest supervisory concern.”  See chart in the 
prepared statement of Treasury IG Eric Thorson at 7, reprinted in April 16, 2010 Subcommittee Hearing at 107. 

168 

had temporary offices at Washington Mutual for accessing bank information, collecting data 
from bank employees, performing analyses, and conducting other exam activities.  Washington 
Mutual formed a Regulatory Relations office charged with overseeing its interactions and 
managing its relationships with personnel at OTS, the FDIC, and other regulators.  

During the year, OTS examiners issued “findings memoranda,” which set forth particular 

examination findings, and required a written response and corrective action plan from WaMu 
management.  The memoranda contained three types of findings.  The least severe was an 
“observation,” defined as a “weakness identified that is not of regulatory concern, but which may 
improve the bank’s operating effectiveness if addressed. …  Observations may or may not be 
reviewed during subsequent examinations.”  The next level of finding was a “recommendation,” 
defined as a “secondary concern requiring corrective action. …  They may be included in the 
Report of Examination … Management’s actions to address Recommendations are reviewed at 
subsequent or follow-up examinations.”  The most severe type of finding was a “criticism,” 
defined as a “primary concern requiring corrective action … often summarized in the ‘Matters 
Requiring Board Attention’ … section of the Report of Examination. … They are subject to 
formal follow-up by examiners and, if left uncorrected, may result in stronger action.”606

   

The most serious OTS examination findings were elevated to Washington Mutual Bank’s 

Board of Directors by designating them as a “Matter Requiring Board Attention” (MRBA).  
MRBAs were set forth in the ROE and presented to the Board in an annual meeting attended by 
OTS and FDIC personnel.  Washington Mutual tracked OTS findings, along with its own 
responses, through an internal system called Enterprise Risk Issue Control System (ERICS).  
ERICS was intended to help WaMu manage its relationship with its regulators by storing the 
regulators’ findings in one central location.  In one of its more unusual discoveries, the 
Subcommittee learned that OTS also came to rely largely on ERICS to track its dealings with 
WaMu.  OTS’ reliance on WaMu’s tracking system was a unique departure from its usual 
practice of separately tracking the status of its past examination findings and a bank’s 
responses.

607

 

The FDIC also participated in the examinations of Washington Mutual.  Because WaMu 

was one of the eight largest insured banks in the country, the FDIC assigned a full-time 
Dedicated Examiner to oversee its operations.  Typically, the FDIC examiners worked with the 
primary regulator and participated in or relied upon the examinations scheduled by that regulator, 
rather than initiating separate FDIC examinations.  At least once per year, the FDIC examiner 
performed an evaluation of the institution’s risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund, typically relying 
primarily on the annual Report on Examination (ROE) issued by the primary regulator and the 
ROE’s individual and composite CAMELS ratings for the institution.  After reviewing the ROE 
as well as other examination and financial information, the FDIC examiner reviewed the 
CAMELS ratings for WaMu to ensure they were appropriate.   

                                                      
606 Descriptions of these terms appeared in OTS findings memoranda. See, e.g., 6/19/2008 OTS Findings 
Memorandum of Washington Mutual Bank, at Bisset_John-00046124_002, Hearing Exhibit 4/16-12a. 
607 See April 16, 2010 Subcommittee Hearing at 21 (information supplied by Treasury IG Thorson for the record).

In addition, for institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, the FDIC had established a 
Large Insured Depository Institutions (LIDI) Program to assess and report on emerging risks that 
may pose a threat to the Deposit Insurance Fund.  Under that program, the FDIC Dedicated 
Examiner and other FDIC regional case managers performed ongoing analysis of emerging risks 
within each covered institution and assigned it a quarterly risk rating, using a scale of A to E, 
with A being the best rating and E the worst.  In addition, senior FDIC analysts within the 
Complex Financial Institutions Branch analyzed specific bank risks and developed supervisory 
strategies.  If the FDIC viewed an institution as imposing an increasing risk to the Deposit 
Insurance Fund, it could perform one or more “special examinations” to take a closer look. 

C.  Washington Mutual Examination History 

For the five-year period, from 2004 to 2008, OTS repeatedly identified significant 

problems with Washington Mutual’s lending practices, risk management, appraisal procedures, 
and issued securities, and requested corrective action.  WaMu promised to correct the identified 
deficiencies, but failed to do so.  OTS failed, in turn, to take enforcement action to ensure the 
corrections were made, until the bank began losing billions of dollars.  OTS also resisted and at 
times impeded FDIC examination efforts at Washington Mutual. 

(1)  Regulatory Challenges Related to Washington Mutual 
Washington Mutual was a larger and more complex financial institution than any other 
thrift overseen by OTS, and presented numerous regulatory challenges.  By 2007, Washington 
Mutual had over $300 billion in assets, 43,000 employees, and over 2,300 branches in 15 states, 
including a securitization office on Wall Street, a massive loan portfolio, and several lines of 
business, including home loans, credit cards, and commercial real estate. 

Integration Issues.  During the 1990s, as described in the prior chapter, WaMu 

embarked upon a strategy of growth through acquisition of smaller institutions, and over time 
became one of the largest mortgage lenders in the United States.  One consequence of its 
acquisition strategy was that WaMu struggled with the logistical and managerial challenges of 
integrating a variety of lending platforms, information technology systems, staff, and policies 
into one system. 

OTS was concerned about and critical of WaMu’s integration efforts.  In a 2004 Report 

on Examination (ROE), OTS wrote: 

“Our review disclosed that past rapid growth through acquisition and unprecedented 
mortgage refinance activity placed significant operational strain on [Washington Mutual] 
during the early part of the review period.  Beginning in the second half of 2003, market 
conditions deteriorated, and the failure of [Washington Mutual] to fully integrate past 
mortgage banking acquisitions, address operational issues, and realize expectations from 

170 

certain major IT initiatives exposed the institution’s infrastructure weaknesses and began 
to negatively impact operating results.”608

 

Long Beach.  One of WaMu’s acquisitions, in 1999, was Long Beach Mortgage 

Company (Long Beach), a subprime lender that became a source of significant management, 
asset quality, and risk problems.  Long Beach’s headquarters were located in Long Beach, 
California, but as a subsidiary of Washington Mutual Inc., the parent holding company of 
Washington Mutual Bank, it was subject to regulation by the State of Washington Department of 
Financial Institutions and the FDIC.  Long Beach’s business model was to purchase subprime 
loans from third party mortgage brokers and lenders and then sell or securitize the loans for sale 
to investors.   

For the first seven years, from 1999 to 2006, OTS had no direct jurisdiction over Long 

Beach, since it was a subsidiary of WaMu’s parent holding company, but not a subsidiary of the 
bank itself.  OTS was limited to reviewing Long Beach indirectly by examining its effect on the 
holding company and WaMu.  In late 2003, OTS examiners took greater notice of Long Beach 
after WaMu’s legal department halted Long Beach’s securitizations while it helped the company 
strengthen its internal controls.  As many as 4,000 Long Beach loans were of such poor quality 
that three quarters of them could not be sold to investors.  In 2005, Long Beach experienced a 
surge in early payment defaults, was forced to repurchase a significant number of loans, lost over 
$107 million, and overwhelmed its loss reserves.  Washington Mutual requested permission to 
make Long Beach a division of the bank, so that it could assert greater control over Long 
Beach’s operations, and in March 2006, OTS approved the purchase with conditions.  In 2006, 
Long Beach experienced another surge of early payment defaults and was forced to repurchase 
additional loans.  When Long Beach loans continued to have problems in 2007, Washington 
Mutual eliminated Long Beach as a separate operation and rebranded it as a Washington Mutual 
“Wholesale Specialty Lending” division.  In August 2007, after the collapse of the subprime 
secondary market, WaMu stopped offering subprime loans and discontinued the last vestiges of 
the Long Beach operation. 

High Risk Lending.  In 2004, Washington Mutual shifted its strategy toward the 

issuance and purchase of higher risk home loans.  OTS took note of the strategic shift in WaMu’s 
2004 ROE: 

 
“Management provided us with a copy of the framework for WMI’s 5-year (2005-2009) 
strategic plan [which] contemplates asset growth of at least 10% a year, with assets 
increasing to near $500 billion by 2009.”609

issues (miscoding which results in misdeliveries, expensive and time consuming data reconciliations), and has been 
exceedingly patient.”).

The result was the bank’s January 2005 High Risk Lending Strategy, discussed in the 

OTS recommended, and the bank agreed, to spell out its new lending strategy in a written 
document that had to be approved by the WaMu Board of Directors.610
 
 
prior chapter, in which WaMu management obtained the approval of its Board to shift its focus 
from originating lower risk fixed rate and government backed loans to higher risk subprime, 
home equity, and Option ARM loans.611  The High Risk Lending Strategy also outlined WaMu’s 
plans to increase its issuance of higher risk loans to borrowers with a higher risk profile.  The 
purpose of the shift was to maximize profits by originating loans with the highest profit margins, 
which were usually the highest risk loans.  According to actual loan data analyzed by WaMu, 
higher risk loans, such as subprime, Option ARM, and home equity loans, produced a higher 
“gain on sale” or profit for the bank compared to lower risk loans.  For example, a presentation 
supporting the High Risk Lending Strategy indicated that selling subprime loans garnered more 
than eight times the gain on sale as government backed loans.612
 

 

The WaMu submission to the Board noted that, in order for the plan to be successful, 

WaMu would need to carefully manage its residential mortgage business as well as its credit risk, 
meaning the risk that borrowers would not repay the higher risk loans.613  During the Board’s 
discussion of the strategy, credit officers noted that losses would likely lag by several years.614 
WaMu executives knew that even if loan losses did not immediately materialize, the strategy 
presented potentially significant risks down the road.  OTS did not object to the High Risk 
Lending Strategy, even though OTS noted that the bank’s five-year plan did not articulate a 
robust plan for managing the increased risk.615

Even before it received formal Board approval, Washington Mutual had begun shifting 
its loan originations toward higher risk loans.  By 2007, rising defaults and the collapse of the 
subprime secondary market prevented WaMu from fully implementing its plans, but it did have 
time to shift the composition of the loans it originated and purchased, increasing the percentage 
of higher risk home loans from at least 19% in 2003, to over 47% in 2007.616

Over the course of nearly three years, from 2005 to 2007, WaMu issued and securitized 

hundreds of billions of high risk loans, including $49 billion in subprime loans617 and $59 billion 
in Option ARMs.618  Data compiled by the Treasury and the FDIC Inspectors General showed 
that, by the end of 2007, Option ARMs constituted about 47% of all home loans on WaMu’s 
balance sheet, of which about 56% of the borrowers were making the minimum payment 
amounts.619  The data also showed that 84% of the total value of the Option ARMs was 
negatively amortizing, meaning that the borrowers were going into deeper debt rather than 
paying off their loan balances.620

ARMs, 50% of its subprime loans, and 90% of its home equity loans.621  WaMu also originated 
numerous loans with high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, in which the loan amount exceeded 80% 
of the value of the underlying property.  The Inspectors General determined, for example, that 
44% of WaMu’s subprime loans and 35% of its home equity loans had LTV ratios in excess of 
80%.622  Still another problem was that WaMu had high concentrations of its home loans in 
California and Florida, states that ultimately suffered above-average home value depreciation.623

   

WaMu issued loans through its own retail loan offices, through Long Beach, which 

issued subprime loans initiated by third party mortgage brokers, and through correspondent and 
conduit programs in which the bank purchased loans from third parties.  The Treasury and the 
FDIC Inspectors General observed that, from 2003 to 2007, 48 to 70% of WaMu’s residential 
mortgages came from third party mortgage brokers, and that only 14 WaMu employees were 
responsible for overseeing more than 34,000 third party brokers, 
employee to oversee more than 2,400 third party brokers.

When the subprime market collapsed in July 2007, Washington Mutual was left holding a 

 
portfolio saturated with high risk, poorly performing loans.  Prior to the collapse, WaMu had 
sold or securitized the majority of the loans it had originated or purchased, undermining the U.S. 
home loan mortgage market with hundreds of billions of dollars in high risk, poor quality loans.  
OTS documentation shows that WaMu’s regulators saw what was happening, identified the 
problems, but then took no enforcement actions to protect either Washington Mutual or the U.S. 
financial system from the bank’s shoddy lending practices. 

(2)  Overview of Washington Mutual’s Ratings History and Closure 

An overview of Washington Mutual’s ratings history shows how OTS and the FDIC were 

required to work together to oversee Washington Mutual, which the two agencies did with 
varying levels of success.  At times, the relationship was productive and useful, while at others 
they found themselves bitterly at odds over how to proceed.  As Washington Mutual’s problems 
intensified, the working relationship between OTS and the FDIC grew more dysfunctional. 

From 2004 to 2006, Washington Mutual was a profitable bank and enjoyed a 2 CAMELS 

rating from both agencies, signifying it was a fundamentally sound institution.  In late 2006, as 
housing prices began to level off for the first time in years, subprime loans began to experience 
delinquencies and defaults.  In part because borrowers were unable to refinance their loans, those 
delinquencies and defaults accelerated in 2007.  The poorly performing loans began to affect the 
payments supporting subprime mortgage backed securities, which began to incur losses.  In July 
2007, the subprime market was performing so poorly that the major credit rating agencies 
suddenly downgraded hundreds of subprime mortgage backed securities, including over 40 
issued by Long Beach.  The subprime market slowed and then collapsed, and Washington 
Mutual was suddenly left with billions of dollars in unmarketable subprime loans and securities

that were plummeting in value.  WaMu stopped issuing subprime loans.  In the fourth quarter of 
2007, WaMu reported a $1 billion loss.   

As housing prices slowed and even began declining in some parts of the country, high 
risk prime loans, including hybrid adjustable rate mortgages, Alt A, and Option ARMs, also 
began incurring delinquencies and defaults.625  By March 2008, the total delinquency rate for 
prime/Alt A loans underlying WaMu and Long Beach securitizations was 8.57%, more than 
twice the industry average.626  In 2008, WaMu did not issue any new high risk, nonconforming 
mortgage securitizations due to, in the words of OTS, “continued market illiquidity, deterioration 
in the financial condition of the market, and the poor performance of WaMu’s outstanding 
securitizations.”627

 

In the first quarter of 2008, WaMu continued to incur losses as the value of its loan 

portfolio and mortgage backed securities continued to drop.  In February 2008, OTS downgraded 
Washington Mutual for the first time, changing its CAMELS rating from a 2 to a 3, signifying 
that the bank was in trouble.  Unfortunately, OTS did not follow up with a suitable enforcement 
action.  Consistent with its own practice, OTS should have required WaMu to enter into a public 
Memorandum of Understanding specifying the measures WaMu would take to remedy its 
problems.  Instead, in March, OTS allowed WaMu to issue a nonpublic Board Resolution in 
which the WaMu Board generally promised to address various problems, but did not identify any 
specific actions or deadlines.

    

628

Also in March 2008, at the urging of the FDIC, OTS required Washington Mutual to 

allow potential buyers of the bank to conduct due diligence of its assets and operations.
  
Several institutions participated, and JPMorgan Chase made an offer to buy the bank which 
Washington Mutual turned down.  By the end of the first quarter of 2008, Washington Mutual 
had lost another $1 billion. In April 2008, to reassure the market and its depositors, the holding 
company raised additional capital of $7 billion from the private sector and provided $3 billion of 
those funds to the bank.  But by the end of the second quarter, WaMu lost another $3.2 billion.  
Its stock price plummeted, and depositors began withdrawing substantial sums from the bank.   

629

In June 2008, as a result of the bank’s financial and deposit losses, the FDIC downgraded 
WaMu to its lowest internal LIDI rating, an E, indicating “serious concern” that the bank would 
                                                      
625 WaMu’s Chief Credit Officer informed the Board of Directors that WaMu was “heavily concentrated” in 
residential mortgages and high risk products as well as in “highly stressed” geographic markets, which negatively 
affected WaMu’s portfolio performance.  See 2/25/2008 Credit Risk Overview Report to the Board of Directors, 
prepared by John McMurray, WaMu Chief Credit Officer, JPM_WM02548447, at 28-29.  He reported that WaMu’s 
mortgages were 1366% of its common tangible equity, the highest percentage of any of the top 20 banks.  He also 
informed the Board that the bank’s residential mortgages “performed very poorly” and WaMu had “generally 
retained higher risk products (e.g., Option ARMS, 2nd Liens, Subprime, Low Doc).”

Other financial institutions were also failing, compounding the concern of those who 

worried whether the Deposit Insurance Fund had sufficient funds.  In July 2008, IndyMac Bank, 
631  In response, 
another thrift with high risk loans, failed and was taken over by the FDIC.
Washington Mutual depositors began to withdraw more funds from the bank, eventually

In the final three months before WaMu’s collapse, tensions increased further between 

OTS and the FDIC as they disagreed on the course of action.  On July 3, 2008, the head of OTS 
sent an email to the CEO of WaMu informing him that the agency had decided to require the 
bank to issue a nonpublic Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
FDIC met with the WaMu Board of Directors to discuss the latest examination findings and 
formally advise the Board of the OTS decision to require the MOU.  On July 21, 2008, the FDIC 
sent a letter to OTS urging it to take tough supervisory action in the MOU, including by 
requiring WaMu to increase its loan loss reserves, begin providing regular financial updates, and 
raise an additional $5 billion in capital.635  OTS rejected the FDIC’s advice.636  On July 31, 2008, 
both OTS and FDIC officials met with WaMu’s Board.  An FDIC official suggested at the Board 
meeting that WaMu look for a strategic partner to buy or invest in the bank; OTS expressed 
anger that the FDIC had raised the issue without first clearing it with OTS.637

management, and board oversight.  On August 4, WaMu asked OTS to drop the requirement that 
the consultant review the Board’s oversight efforts, and OTS agreed.   

On August 6, the FDIC Chairman asked the OTS Director to discuss contingency plans 
for an emergency closure of the bank.  The OTS Director reacted negatively and sent an email 
criticizing the FDIC Chairman for acting as if it were the primary regulator of the bank.640

the agencies argued amongst themselves, the bank’s condition continued to deteriorate.

On September 10, 2008, the FDIC Chairman, Sheila Bair, informed WaMu that there was 

a ratings disagreement between the FDIC and OTS, and that the FDIC was likely to downgrade 
WaMu to a 4.  When she informed the OTS Director, John Reich, of her conversation with 
WaMu, he sent an internal email to his deputy, Scott Polakoff, venting his frustration that she 
had not discussed the matter with him first and allowed OTS to break the news to the bank: “I 
cannot believe the continuing audacity of this woman.”

problems, OTS and the FDIC decided they had to close the bank.646

    

Due to the bank’s worsening liquidity crisis, the regulators abandoned their customary 
practice of waiting until markets closed on Friday, and on Thursday, September 25, 2008, OTS 
closed Washington Mutual Bank and appointed the FDIC as receiver.  The FDIC immediately 
sold the bank to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion.  If the sale had not gone through, Washington 
Mutual’s $300 billion failure might have exhausted the entire $45 billion Deposit Insurance 
Fund.

(3)  OTS Identification of WaMu Deficiencies  

177 

During the five-year period reviewed by the Subcommittee, from 2004 through 2008, 
OTS examiners identified over 500 serious deficiencies in Washington Mutual’s lending, risk 
management, and appraisal practices.647
  OTS examiners also criticized the poor quality loans 
and mortgage backed securities issued by Long Beach, and received FDIC warnings regarding 
the bank’s high risk activities.  When WaMu failed in 2008, it was not a case of hidden problems 
coming to light; the bank’s examiners were well aware of and had documented the bank’s high 
risk, poor quality loans and deficient lending practices. 

(a)  Deficiencies in Lending Standards 
From 2004 to 2008, OTS Findings Memoranda and annual Reports of Examination 

(ROE) repeatedly identified deficiencies in WaMu’s lending standards and practices.  Lending 
standards, also called “underwriting” standards, determine the types of loans that a loan officer 
may offer or purchase from a third party mortgage broker.  These standards determine, for 
example, whether the loan officer may issue a “stated income” loan without verifying the 
borrower’s professed income, issue a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score, or issue a loan 
providing 90% or even 100% of the appraised value of the property being purchased.   

When regulators criticize a bank’s lending or “underwriting” standards as weak or 

unsatisfactory, they are expressing concern that the bank is setting its standards too low, issuing 
risky loans that may not be repaid, and opening up the bank to later losses that could endanger its 
safety and soundness.  When they criticize a bank for excessively high lending or underwriting 
“errors,” regulators are expressing concern that the bank’s loan officers are failing to comply 
with the bank’s standards, such as by issuing a loan that finances 90% of a property’s appraised 
value when the bank’s lending standards prohibit issuing loans that finance more than 80% of the 
appraised value.   

In addition to errors, regulators may express concern about the extent to which a bank 
allows its loan officers to make “exceptions” to its lending standards and issue a loan that does 
not comply with some aspects of its lending standards.  Exceptions that are routinely approved 
can undermine the effectiveness of a bank’s formal lending standards.  Another common 
problem is inadequate loan documentation indicating whether or not a particular loan complies 
with the bank’s lending standards, such as loan files that do not include a property’s appraised 
value, the source of the borrower’s income, or key analytics such as the loan-to-value or debt-to-
income ratios.  In the case of Washington Mutual, from 2004 to 2008, OTS examiners routinely 
found all four sets of problems:  weak standards, high error and exception rates, and poor loan 
documentation. 

2004 Lending Deficiencies.  In 2004, OTS examiners identified a variety of problems 
with WaMu’s lending standards.  In May of that year, an OTS Findings Memorandum stated: 

                                                      
647 See IG Report at 28. 

178 

“Several of our recent examinations concluded that the Bank’s single family loan 
underwriting was less than satisfactory due to excessive errors in the underwriting 
process, loan document preparation, and in associated activities.”648

 

After reviewing an OTS examination of a loan sample, the FDIC examiner wrote that the loans: 

“reflected inconsistencies with underwriting and documentation practices, particularly in 
the brokered channel.  Additionally, examiners noted that Washington Mutual’s SFR 
[Single Family Residential] portfolio has an elevated level of risk to a significant volume 
of potential negative amortization loans, high delinquency and exception rates, and a 
substantial volume of loans with higher risk characteristics, such as low FICO scores.”649

 

A few months later, in September, an OTS review of a sample of 2003 WaMu loans 

found “critical error rates as high as 57.3%”:   

“[Residential Quality Assurance]’s review of 2003 originations disclosed critical error 
rates as high as 57.3 percent of certain loan samples, thereby indicating that SFR [Single 
Family Residential] underwriting still requires much improvement.  While this group has 
appropriately identified underwriting deficiencies, it has not been as successful in 
effecting change.”650

   

The same OTS Report of Examination observed that one of the three causes of underwriting 
deficiencies was “a sales culture focused on building market share.”  It also stated:  

“Notwithstanding satisfactory asset quality overall, some areas still require focused 
management and Board attention.  Most important is the need to address weaknesses in 
single-family residential (SFR) underwriting, which is an ongoing issue from prior 
exams.”651

   

The OTS ROE concluded:  “Underwriting of SFR loans remains less than satisfactory.”

652

   

The next month, when OTS conducted a field visit to follow up on some of the problems 

identified earlier, it concluded: 

“The level of SFR [Single Family Residential] underwriting exceptions in our samples 
has been an ongoing examination issue for several years and one that management has 
found difficult to address.  The institution instituted a major organizational/staffing

realignment in September 2003 and has continued to make additional adjustments since 
that time to address accumulating control issues.”653

 

2005 Lending Deficiencies.  In early 2005, OTS elevated the problems with the bank’s 

 
lending standards to the attention of the WaMu Board of Directors.  In a letter to the Board, OTS 
wrote: 

“SFR Loan Underwriting – This has been an area of concern for several exams.  As 
management continues to make change in organization, staffing, and structure related to 
SFR loan underwriting, delays in meeting target dates become inevitable.  The board 
should closely monitor these delays to ensure they do not become protracted.”654

  

OTS officials attended a Board meeting to address this and other concerns.  Yet a few months 
later, in June, an OTS examiner wrote:  “We continue to have concerns regarding the number of 
655  
underwriting exceptions and with issues that evidence lack of compliance with Bank policy.”
The examination findings memorandum also noted that, while WaMu tried to make changes, 
those changes produced “only limited success” and loan underwriting remained “less than 
satisfactory.”656
 
had not been resolved:   

In August 2005, the OTS ROE for the year indicated that the lending standards problem 

 

“[W]e remain concerned with the number of underwriting exceptions and with issues that 
evidence lack of compliance with bank policy ….  [T]he level of deficiencies, if left 
unchecked, could erode the credit quality of the portfolio.  Our concerns are increased 
with the risk profile of the portfolio is considered, including concentrations in Option 
ARM loans to higher-risk borrowers, in low and limited documentation loans, and loans 
with subprime or higher-risk characteristics.  We are concerned further that the current 
market environment is masking potentially higher credit risk.”657
2006 Lending Deficiencies.  The same problems continued into 2006.  In March 2006, 

 
OTS issued the same strong warning about WaMu’s loan portfolio that it had provided in August 
2005: 

   

“We believe the level of delinquencies, if left unchecked, could erode the credit quality of 
the portfolio.  Our concerns are increased when the risk profile of the portfolio is 
considered, including concentrations in Option ARMS to higher-risk borrowers, in low 
and limited documentation loans, and loans with subprime or higher-risk characteristics.

We are concerned further that the current market environment is masking potentially 
higher credit risk.”658
Two months later, in May 2006, an OTS examiner wrote:  
“During the prior examination, we noted numerous instances of underwriters exceeding 
underwriting guidelines, errors in income calculations, errors in debt-to-income (DTI) 
calculations, lack of sufficient mitigating factors for credit-quality related issues, and 
insufficient title insurance coverage on negative amortization loans.  …  [U]nderwriting 
errors [] continue to require management’s attention.”659
While OTS was documenting its concerns, however, it is apparent in hindsight that the 

   

agency tempered its criticism.  The OTS examiner who authored the memo found that in his 
review, none of the negatively amortizing loans he analyzed for safety and soundness carried an 
“exception,” meaning it “probably should not have been made.”
  Many of the loans made in 
this time period would later default. 

660

Another OTS Findings Memorandum the same month concluded:  “Overall, we 

concluded that the number and severity of underwriting errors noted remain at higher than 
acceptable levels.”

661

 

 

The 2006 OTS ROE for the year concluded:   
“[S]ubprime underwriting practices remain less than satisfactory.  …  [T]he number and 
severity of underwriting exceptions and errors remain at higher than acceptable levels.  
…  The findings of this judgmental sample are of particular concern since loans with risk 
layering … should reflect more, rather than less, stringent underwriting.”662
2007 Lending Deficiencies.  In 2007, the problems with WaMu’s lending standards were 

   

no better, and the acceleration of high risk loan delinquencies and defaults threatened serious 
consequences.   

By July 2007, the major credit rating agencies had begun mass ratings downgrades of 

 
hundreds of mortgage backed securities, the subprime secondary market froze, and WaMu was 
left holding billions of dollars worth of suddenly unmarketable subprime and other high risk 
loans.  In September, the OTS ROE for the year concluded: 

“Underwriting policies, procedures, and practices were in need of improvement, 
particularly with respect to stated income lending.  Based on our current findings, and the

181 

fact that a number of similar concerns were raised at prior examinations, we concluded 
that too much emphasis was placed on loan production, often at the expense of loan 
quality.”663

 

The ROE also reported on an unsatisfactory review of loans that had been originated by Long 
Beach and warned that, if the problems were not promptly corrected, “heightened supervisory 
action would be taken”: 

“Based on our review of 75 subprime loans originated by [Long Beach], we concluded 
that subprime underwriting practices remain less than satisfactory ….  Given that this is a 
repeat concern and MRBA [Matter Requiring Board Attention], we informed 
management that underwriting must be promptly corrected, or heightened supervisory 
action would be taken, including limiting the Bank’s ability to continue SFR subprime 
underwriting.”664
In the fourth quarter of 2007, WaMu’s loan portfolio lost $1 billion in value.  Despite that 
loss, and the strong language in the 2007 examinations, OTS took no enforcement action against 
the bank that would result in WaMu’s tightening its lending standards or strengthening 
compliance with the standards it had. 

 

2008 Lending Deficiencies.  In the first six months of 2008, WaMu continued to incur 
billions of dollars in losses, as its high risk loan portfolio lost value and its share price fell.  In 
July 2008, about two months before the bank failed, OTS met with the WaMu Board of Directors 
to discuss, among other matters, the bank’s deficient lending standards.  While the presentation 
to the Board reiterated the concerns from past years, it failed to convey a sense of urgency to a 
bank on the verge of collapse.  Instead, the presentation focused on long term corrective action 
that WaMu should take.  The OTS written presentation to the Board included the following: 
“High SFR [Single Family Residential] losses due in part to downturn in real estate 
market but exacerbated by:  geographic concentrations[,] risk layering[,] liberal 
underwriting policy[,] poor underwriting. …  Discontinuing higher risk lending and 
tightened underwriting policy should improve asset quality; however, actions should have 
been taken sooner. … 
Significant underwriting and process weaknesses noted again in the Home Loans 
Group[.] ...  Reducing higher risk lending products and practices should have been done 
sooner.”665
Failure to Correct Deficient Lending Practices.  In various reports for nearly five 

consecutive years, OTS criticized WaMu’s lending standards, error and exception rates, and loan 
documentation, and directed the bank to improve its performance.  When WaMu failed to 
improve during that span, OTS failed to take action, such as requiring a board resolution,

memorandum of understanding, or cease and desist order compelling WaMu to tighten its 
lending standards and increase oversight of its loan officers to reduce underwriting error and 
exception rates and improve loan documentation.  The result was that WaMu originated or 
purchased hundreds of billions of dollars of high risk loans, including stated income loans 
without verification of the borrower’s assets or ability to repay the loan; loans with low FICO 
scores and high loan-to-value ratios; loans that required interest-only payments; and loan 
payments that did not cover even the interest owed, much less the principal.   

(b)  Deficiencies in Risk Management 

Over the same five-year period, from 2004 to 2008, in addition to identifying deficiencies 

associated with WaMu’s lending practices, OTS repeatedly identified problems with WaMu’s 
risk management practices.  Risk management involves identifying, evaluating, and mitigating 
the risks that threaten the safety, soundness, and profitability of an institution.  At thrifts, the 
primary risk issues include setting lending standards that will produce profitable loans, enforcing 
those standards, evaluating the loan portfolio, identifying home loans that may default, 
establishing adequate reserves to cover potential losses, and advising on measures to lower the 
identified risks.  When regulators criticize a bank’s risk management practices as weak or 
unsatisfactory, they are expressing concern that the bank is failing to identify the types of risk 
that threaten the bank’s safety and soundness and failing to take actions to reduce and manage 
those risks. 

Within WaMu, from 2004-2005, oversight of risk management practices was assigned to 

a Chief Risk Officer.  In 2006, it was assigned to an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
Department headed by a Chief Enterprise Risk Officer.  ERM employees reported, not only to 
the department, but also to particular lines of business such as the WaMu Home Loans Division, 
and reported both to the Chief Risk Officer and to the head of the business line, such as the 
president of the Home Loans Division.  WaMu referred to this system of reporting as a “Double-
Double.”666

 

As with the bank’s poor lending standards, OTS allowed ongoing risk management 

problems to fester without taking enforcement action.  From 2004 to 2008, OTS explicitly and 
repeatedly alerted the WaMu Board of Directors to the need to strengthen the bank’s risk 
management practices.   

2004 Risk Management Deficiencies.  In 2004, prior to the bank’s adoption of its High 

Risk Lending Strategy, OTS expressed concern about the bank’s risk management practices, 
highlighted the issue in the annual ROE, and brought it to the attention of the WaMu Board of 
Directors.  The 2004 ROE stated:

(2/6/2010). 

183 

“Board oversight and management performance has been satisfactory … but … increased 
operational risks warrant prompt attention.  These issues limit the institution’s flexibility 
and may threaten its ability to remain competitive and independent.”667

Another OTS examination that focused on WaMu’s holding company identified multiple

management areas.”

Company remain regulatory risk, reputation risk, and liquidity of the secondary market in 
subprime loans.”
 
requirement that WaMu commit its high risk lending strategy to paper and gain explicit approval 
from the Board of Directors. 

Its concern about WaMu’s risk management practices prompted, in part, OTS’ 

   

669

2005 Risk Management Deficiencies.  In 2005, after adoption of the High Risk Lending 

Strategy, OTS again highlighted risk management issues in its examination reports and again 
brought the matter to the attention of WaMu’s Board of Directors.   

 
In March 2005, OTS observed that WaMu’s five-year strategy, which increased credit 

risk for the bank, did not “clearly articulate the need to first focus on addressing the various 
operational challenges before embarking on new and potentially more risky growth 
initiatives.”670  OTS also wrote:  “We discussed the lack of a clear focus in the plan on resolving 
operational challenges with CEO Killinger and the Board.”671
concerns about the bank’s weak risk management practices for the rest of the year, yet took no 
concrete enforcement action to compel the bank to address the issue.  In June 2005, OTS 
described risk management weaknesses within WaMu’s Corporate Risk Oversight group, a sub-
group within the ERM Department responsible for evaluating credit and compliance risk.  OTS 
wrote that it had deemed its comments as “criticisms” of the bank, because of the significance of 
the risk management function in addressing ongoing problems with the bank’s lending standards 
and loan error rates: 

  OTS continued to express 

 
“Most of the findings are considered ‘criticisms’ due to the overall significance of CRO 
[Corporate Risk Oversight] activities and the fact that we have had concerns with quality 
assurance and underwriting processes within home lending for several years.”672
 
In August 2005, in its annual Report on Examination, OTS urged the WaMu Board to 

   

obtain progress reports from the ERM Department and ensure it had sufficient resources to

become an effective counterweight to the increased risk-taking entailed in the High Risk Lending 
Strategy:  

 
“Monitor and obtain reports from management on status of [Enterprise Risk 
Management] in terms of effectiveness and resource adequacy.  …  ERM provides an 
important check and balance on the company’s profit-oriented units and warrants 
ongoing strong Board commitment given the institution’s current strategic direction.”673

   

The same ROE noted that the bank did not have effective procedures in place to evaluate the 
many exceptions being granted to allow loan officers to issue loans that failed to comply with the 
bank’s lending standards, and urged attention to the risks being established: 

“Until full exception data collection, reporting, and follow-up processes are in place and 
stabilized, senior management and the Board cannot fully assess whether quality 
assurance processes are having a meaningful impact on line activities, including loan 
underwriting.  We are particularly concerned with the establishment of good quality 
assurance process for SFR underwriting, which has been an issue for the past several 
examinations.”674

 

A follow-up field examination, conducted in September 2005, stated: 

“We criticized the lack of Trend and Dashboard Report to senior management and the 
board, without which it is impossible to determine whether line functions are performing 
acceptably and, more specifically, whether the quality assurance process is having a 
meaningful impact on improving loan underwriting.”675
2006 Risk Management Deficiencies.  In 2006, OTS again expressed concern about 
WaMu’s risk management practices, but took no further steps to compel improvements.  The 
annual ROE urged the Board of Directors to:  

 

 
“[c]ontinue to monitor and obtain reports from management on the status of ERM to 
ensure its effectiveness and adequacy of resources.  . . . ERM should provide an 
important check and balance on profit-oriented units … particularly given the bank’s 
current strategy involving increased credit risk.” 676

   

The 2006 ROE also commented that:  “[w]ithin ERM, fraud risk management at the enterprise 
level is in the early stage of development. …  Currently, fraud management is decentralized and 
does not provide a streamlined process to effectively track fraud events across all business lines.  
In addition, consistent fraud reporting capabilities are not in place to consolidate data for 
analysis, reporting, and risk management at the enterprise level.”

2007 Risk Management Deficiencies.  In 2007, as high risk loan delinquencies and 

defaults accelerated and WaMu began to incur losses, OTS examiners used harsher language to 
describe the deficiencies in WaMu’s risk management practices, criticizing the bank’s failure to 
institute stronger risk controls and procedures at an earlier date, as recommended.   

In June 2007, for example, OTS examiners completed a review critical of WaMu 

procedures to oversee the loans it purchased from third party mortgage brokers.678  From 2003 to 
2007, 48 to 70% of WaMu’s loans were purchased from third parties.679  An OTS memorandum 
noted that Washington Mutual had only 14 full-time employees overseeing more than 34,000 
third party brokers submitting loans to the bank for approval.  OTS also criticized the scorecard 
used to rate those brokers which, among other problems, did not include the rate at which 
significant lending or documentation deficiencies were attributed to the broker, the rate at which 
its loans were denied or produced unsaleable loans, or an indication of whether the broker was 
included in industry watchlists for misconduct.  After describing these and other problems, rather 
than lower WaMu’s safety and soundness scores for its poor oversight, however, the OTS 
memorandum made only the following observation:  “Given the . . . increase in fraud, early 
payment defaults, first payment defaults, subprime delinquencies, etc., management should re-
assess the adequacy of staffing.”680  WaMu management agreed with the finding, but provided 
no corrective action plan, stating only that “[s]taffing needs are evaluated continually and 
adjusted as necessary.”681

 

  

In the September 2007 annual ROE, OTS wrote:  

“Risk management practices in the HLG (Home Loans Group) during most of the review 
period were inadequate ….  We believe that there were sufficient negative credit trends 
that should have elicited more aggressive action by management with respect to limiting 
credit exposure.  In particular, as previously noted, the risk misrepresentation in stated 
income loans has been generally reported for some time.  This information should have 
led management to better assess the prudence of stated income lending and curtail riskier 
products well before we indicated during this examination that we would limit the Bank’s 
ability to continue such lending.” 682

  

The ROE also faulted management and Board inaction: 

“Board oversight and management’s performance was less than satisfactory.  …  
Contributing factors should have been more proactively managed by the Board and 
management.  The most significant of these factors include Matters Requiring Board

Attention that were noted in prior examinations but were not adequately addressed, 
including … an ERM function that was not fully effective.”683

   

The ROE concluded:  “The ERM function has been less than effective for some time.  …  ERM 
has not matured in a timely manner and other ERM functions have been generally 
ineffective.”

684

 

A separate OTS examination of WaMu’s compliance function observed that WaMu had 

hired nine different compliance officers in the past seven years, and that “[t]his amount of 
turnover is very unusual for an institution of this size and is a cause for concern.”

685

 

 
Despite these harsh assessments in 2007, OTS again refrained from taking any 
enforcement action against the bank such as developing a nonpublic Memorandum of 
Understanding or a public Cease and Desist Order with concrete plans for strengthening WaMu’s 
risk management efforts. 

 
2008 Risk Management Deficiencies.  In 2008, as WaMu continued to post billions of 

dollars in losses, OTS continued to express concerns about its risk management practices.  In 
February 2008, OTS downgraded WaMu to a 3 CAMELS rating and required the bank to issue a 
Board Resolution committing to certain strategic initiatives including “a more disciplined 
framework for the identification and management of compliance risks.”686

     

In June 2008, OTS issued a Findings Memorandum reacting to a WaMu internal review 

that found significant levels of loan fraud at a particular loan office, and expressed concern “as to 
  The memorandum 
whether similar conditions are systemic throughout the organization.”
noted that “a formalized process did not exist to identify, monitor, resolve, and escalate third 
party complaints” about loan fraud, expressed concern about “an origination culture focused 
more heavily on production volume rather than quality”; noted that the WaMu review had found 
the “loan origination process did not mitigate misrepresentation/fraud”; and described the “need 
to implement incentive compensation programs to place greater emphasis on loan quality.” 

687

As referenced above, in July 2008, two months before the bank’s failure, OTS made a 
presentation to the WaMu Board which, among other problems, criticized its risk management 
efforts: 
 
“An adequate [Enterprise Risk Management] function still does not exist although this 
has been an MRBA [Matter Requiring Board Attention] for some time.  Critical as a 
check and balance for profit oriented units[.]  Necessary to ensure that critical risks are

identified, measured, monitored and communicated[.]  Even more critical given increased 
credit, market, and operational risk.”688
 
Failure to Correct Poor Risk Management.  By neglecting to exercise its enforcement 
authority, OTS chronicled WaMu’s inadequate risk management practices over a period of years, 
but ultimately failed to change its course of action.  During a hearing of the Subcommittee, the 
Department of the Treasury Inspector General, Eric Thorson, whose office conducted an in-depth 
review of WaMu’s regulatory oversight, testified:  

   

“Issues related to poor underwriting and weak risk controls were noted as far back 
as 2003, but the problem was OTS did not ensure that WaMu ever corrected those 
weaknesses.  We had a hard time understanding why OTS would allow these 
satisfactory ratings to continue given that, over the years, they found the same 
things over and over.”689

   

(c)  Deficiencies in Home Appraisals 
Still another area in which OTS failed to take appropriate enforcement action involves 

WaMu’s appraisal practices.  OTS failed to act even after other government entities accused 
WaMu of systematically inflating property values to justify larger and more risky home loans.  

Appraisals provide estimated dollar valuations of property by independent experts.  They 
play a key role in the mortgage lending process, because a property’s appraised value is used to 
determine whether the property provides sufficient collateral to support a loan.  Lending 
standards at most banks require loans to meet, for example, certain loan-to-value (LTV) ratios to 
ensure that, in the event of a default, the property can be sold and the proceeds used to pay off 
any outstanding debt. 

From 2004 to mid-2006, WaMu conducted its own property appraisals as part of the loan 

approval process.  During that period, OTS repeatedly expressed concerns about WaMu’s 
appraisal efforts.690  In May 2005, OTS criticized WaMu – the most severe type of finding – 
regarding its practice of allowing sellers to estimate the value of their property.  OTS directed 
WaMu to stop including an Owner’s Estimate of Value in documents sent to appraisers since it 
biased the review; this criticism had been repeatedly noted in prior examinations, yet WaMu did 
not satisfactorily address it until the end of 2005.691  A second finding criticized WaMu’s use of 
automated appraisal software, noting “significant technical document weaknesses.”692  OTS 
ultimately determined that none of WaMu’s automated appraisals complied with standard 
appraisal practices and some even had “highly questionable value conclusions.”693

  Despite this 

188 

dramatic criticism, OTS found in the next year’s examination that WaMu had continued to use 
noncompliant automated appraisals.694
management agreed to cease using automated appraisals by October 2006. 

  Before any enforcement action was taken, WaMu 

To address the issue, WaMu decided in mid-2006 to outsource its appraisal function to 

695  Calling the move “Project 
two vendors:  eAppraiseIT and Lender Service Incorporated (LSI).
Cornerstone,” WaMu fired all of its residential staff appraisers, reducing a staff of about 400 to 
30,696 and eAppraiseIT and LSI were tasked with conducting appraisals of homes purchased with 
WaMu loans.697
  WaMu assigned oversight of the outside appraisals to a new Appraisal Business 
Oversight (ABO) group, a unit within the WaMu Home Loans Risk Management division.   

The Decision to Outsource.  WaMu’s decision to outsource the appraisal function 

698  Though the bank had repeatedly delayed taking action or failed to respond 

received minimal attention from OTS.  Documentation obtained by the Subcommittee indicates 
only a few meetings took place between OTS examiners and the WaMu staff tasked with the 
outsourcing.  During a Subcommittee interview, the key OTS appraisal expert, Bruce Thorvig, 
explained that it was his first time supervising a large institution that decided to outsource the 
appraisal function.
to OTS recommendations and criticisms in the appraisal area in the past, the OTS appraisal 
expert told the Subcommittee that he saw nothing to indicate that WaMu management could not 
competently handle a large appraisal outsourcing project of this scale.699  In one of the few 
meetings that did occur between WaMu and OTS staff on appraisal issues, the bank’s 
management came away with what they thought was full OTS approval for the outsourcing 
project,700 though OTS’ appraisal expert disputed that he was even in a position to grant approval 
and was instead simply receiving notification of WaMu’s plans.701

  

Appraisal Problems.  Problems began almost immediately after WaMu outsourced the 

appraisal function.  Whether appraisals are conducted internally by the bank or through a vendor, 
the bank must take responsibility for establishing a standard process to ensure accurate, unbiased 
home appraisal values.  One, for example, was a repeat problem from when WaMu did its own 
appraisals:  “WaMu allowed a homeowner’s estimate of the value of the home to be included on 
the form sent from WaMu to third party appraisers, thereby biasing the appraiser’s evaluation” 
toward a higher home value, in violation of standard residential appraisal methods.
seasoned appraisal compliance manager, who oversaw WaMu as an FDIC examiner prior to 
coming to work for the bank, drafted a February 2007 Residential Appraisal Department Review 
which included a long list of issues.  Problems included: “undefined” appraisal standards and 
processes; “loosely defined” vendor management; “unreasonable and imprudent sales force

influence over the appraisal function;” and a “broken” third party appraisal risk control process 
that “may be contributing to the increasing incidence of mortgage fraud.”703

   

These problems continued without resolution or enforcement action from OTS 

throughout 2007.  In an April 2007 memorandum, OTS detailed its concerns, both old and new, 
with WaMu’s appraisal operations.  OTS found that WaMu had failed to update and revise its 
appraisal manual after outsourcing, which put the bank at risk of regulatory violations. In 
addition, an OTS review of 54 WaMu appraisals identified a number of concerns: 

“Primary appraisal issues (red flags requiring attention by the underwriter or review 
appraiser) included seller paid closing costs and concession, misstatements/ 
contradictions, inadequate/incomplete explanations and support for the value conclusion, 
reconciliation of the sales comparison approach, and weakness in the appraisal review 
process.”704

 

Despite the extent of these concerns, OTS issued a “recommendation” to the bank that it address 
the identified problems, rather than the stronger “criticism” which would have elevated the issue 
to the bank’s senior management or Board of Directors.

   

705

Attorney General Complaint.  On November 1, 2007, the New York Attorney General 
issued a complaint against WaMu’s appraisal vendors, LSI and eAppraiseIT, alleging fraud and 
collusion with WaMu to systematically inflate real estate values.

  The complaint stated in part: 

706

“[F]irst American and eAppraiseIT have abdicated their role in providing ‘third-party, 
unbiased valuations’ for eAppraiseIT’s largest client, WaMu.  Instead, eAppraiseIT 
improperly allows WaMu’s loan production staff to hand-pick appraisers who bring in 
appraisal values high enough to permit WaMu’s loans to close, and improperly permits 
WaMu to pressure eAppraiseIT appraisers to change appraisal values that are too low to 
permit loans to close.”

     

707

Though OTS had been aware of the Attorney General’s investigation in May 2007, it 
took no action until after the Attorney General issued the complaint.  Even then, OTS did not 
initiate its own investigation until after an internal WaMu investigation was already underway.  
The OTS Western Region Director advised:  “I believe OTS needs to open up its own special 
investigation.  WaMu started their own special investigation a few days ago when this broke.”

It took nearly a month for OTS to launch its own investigation into the allegations set out 

in the New York Attorney General’s complaint.709
OTS, John Reich, was presented with his agency’s investigation plan, he responded: 

  In November 2007, when the director of 

 

“This appears to be a comprehensive (and impressive) review schedule. It doesn’t 
appear, on the surface anyway, to leverage off of WaMu’s own review. Do you 
think we might be totally reinventing the wheel and possibly taking too long to 
complete our review?”

710

 

Despite his concerns about how long the planned investigation might take, the OTS investigation 
proceeded as proposed.  It took over 10 months, until September 2008, for OTS to gather, 
analyze, and reach conclusions about WaMu’s appraisal practices. 

The OTS investigation uncovered many instances of improper appraisals.  After 

reviewing 225 loan files, the OTS appraisal expert found that “[n]umerous instances were 
identified where, because of undue influence on the appraiser, values were increased without 
supporting documentation.”711  OTS also found that WaMu had violated the agency’s appraisal 
regulations by failing to comply with appraisal independence procedures after they outsourced 
the function.712  The OTS investigation concluded that WaMu’s appraisal practices constituted 
“unsafe or unsound banking practices.”713  The OTS investigation also concluded that WaMu 
was not in compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and other 
minimum appraisal standards.714

   

Failure to Correct Appraisal Deficiencies.  Shortly before WaMu was sold, OTS’ staff 

prepared a draft recommendation that the agency issue a cease and desist order to bar the bank 
from engaging in any activity that would lead to further violation of the appraisal regulations.
A cease and desist order would have been the first public enforcement action against WaMu 
regarding its lending practices.  Ultimately, the legal staff submitted the memorandum to OTS’ 
Deputy Director and Chief Counsel on October 3, 2008, more than a week after the bank 
collapsed and was sold.716
moot.   
 

  By this point, the recommendation was too late and the issue was

(d)  Deficiencies Related to Long Beach  

191 

In 1999, WaMu’s parent holding company, Washington Mutual Inc., purchased Long 

Beach Mortgage Company (Long Beach).  Long Beach’s business model was to issue subprime 
loans initiated by third party mortgage lenders and brokers and then sell or package those loans 
into mortgage backed securities for sale to Wall Street firms.  Beginning in 1999, Washington 
Mutual Bank worked closely with Long Beach to sell or securitize its subprime loans and 
exercised oversight over its lending and securitization operations.  Because Long Beach was a 
subsidiary of Washington Mutual Inc., the holding company, however, and not a subsidiary of 
Washington Mutual Bank, OTS did not have direct regulatory authority over the company, but 
could review its operations to the extent they affected the holding company or the bank itself. 

OTS was aware of ongoing problems with Long Beach’s management, lending and risk 
standards, and issuance of poor quality loans and mortgage backed securities.  OTS reported, for 
example, that Long Beach’s “early operations as a subsidiary of [Washington Mutual Inc.] were 
characterized by a number of weaknesses” including “loan servicing weaknesses, documentation 
exceptions, high delinquencies, and concerns regarding compliance with securitization-related 
representations and warranties.”717  OTS also reported that, in 2003, “adverse internal reviews of 
[Long Beach] operations led to a decision to temporarily cease securitization activity” until a 
“special review” by the WaMu legal department ensured that file documentation “adequately 
supported securitization representations and warranties” made by Long Beach.718
  OTS was 
aware of an examination report issued by a state regulator and the FDIC after a review of 2003 
Long Beach loans, which provides a sense of the extent of problems with those loans at the time: 

“An internal residential quality assurance (RQA) report for [Long Beach]’s first quarter 
2003 … concluded that 40% (109 of 271) of loans reviewed were considered 
unacceptable due to one or more critical errors.  This raised concerns over [Long 
Beach]’s ability to meet the representations and warranty’s made to facilitate sales of 
loan securitizations, and management halted securitization activity.  A separate credit 
review report … disclosed that [Long Beach]’s credit management and portfolio 
oversight practices were unsatisfactory. …  Approximately 4,000 of the 13,000 loans in 
the warehouse had been reviewed … of these, approximately 950 were deemed saleable, 
800 were deemed unsaleable, and the remainder contained deficiencies requiring 
remediation prior to sale. … [O]f 4,500 securitized loans eligible for foreclosure, 10% 
could not be foreclosed due to documentation issues.”
Despite these severe underwriting and operational problems, Long Beach resumed 

719

 

securitization of its subprime loans in 2004.  In April 2005, OTS examiners circulated an internal 
email commenting on the poor quality of Long Beach loans and mortgage backed securities 
compared to its peers:

 “Performance data for 2003 and 2004 vintages appear to approximate industry average 
while issues prior to 2003 have horrible performance.  . . . [Long Beach] finished in the 
top 12 worst annualized [Net Credit Losses] in 1997 and 1999 thru 2003.  [Long Beach 
nailed down the number 1 spot as top loser with an [Net Credit Loss] of 14.1% in 2000 
and placed 3rd in 2001 with 10.5%. …  For ARM [adjustable rate mortgage] losses, [Long 
Beach] really outdid themselves with finishes as one of the top 4 worst performers from 
1999 through 2003.  For specific ARM deals, [Long Beach] made the top 10 worst deal 
list from 2000 thru 2002. … Although underwriting changes were made from 2002 thru 
2004, the older issues are still dragging down overall performance. …  At 2/05, [Long 
Beach] was #1 with a 12% delinquency rate.  Industry was around 8.25%.”720

 

Six months later, after conducting a field visit, an OTS examiner wrote:  “Older securitizations 
of [Long Beach] continue to have some issues due to previously known underwriting issues in 
some vintages.  The deterioration in these older securitizations is not unexpected.”

    

721

Purchase of Long Beach.  In 2005, Washington Mutual Bank proposed purchasing Long 

Beach from its holding company so that Long Beach would become a wholly owned subsidiary 
of the bank.  In making the case for the purchase, which required OTS approval, WaMu 
contended that making Long Beach a subsidiary would give the bank greater control over Long 
Beach’s operations and allow it to strengthen Long Beach’s lending practices and risk 
management, as well as reduce funding costs and administrative expenses.  In addition, WaMu 
proposed that it could replace its current “Specialty Mortgage Finance” program, which involved 
purchasing subprime loans for its portfolio primarily from Ameriquest, with a similar loan 
portfolio provided by Long Beach.

722

 

In June 2005, an OTS examiner expressed concerns about the purchase in an internal 

memorandum to OTS regional management and recommended that the purchase be conditioned 
on operational improvements: 

“At the start of this examination, it was our intent to perform a review of the operation of 
[Long Beach] with the expectation that [Washington Mutual Inc.] or the bank would be 
requesting approval to move [Long Beach] as an operating subsidiary of the bank.  Such 
a move would obviously place the heightened risks of a subprime lending operation 
directly within the regulated institution structure.  Because of the high profile nature of 
the business of [Long Beach] and its problematic history, we believe that any and all 
concerns regarding the subprime operation need to be fully addressed prior to any 
move.”723

193 

The memorandum identified several matters that required resolution prior to a WaMu purchase 
of Long Beach, including the establishment of pre- and post-funding loan quality reviews that 
were already in place at the bank.  The memorandum also stated that Long Beach management 
had “worked diligently to improve its operation and correct significant deficiencies … reported 
in prior years,” and observed, “there is definitely a new attitude and culture.”724

 

OTS continued to review Long Beach’s lending practices and found additional 

deficiencies throughout the year.  Those deficiencies included errors in loan calculations of debt-
to-income ratios, lack of documentation to support the reasonableness of borrower income on 
stated income loans, and lack of explanation of a borrower’s ability to handle payment shock on 
loans with rising interest rates.
portfolio of subprime loans “had attributes that could result in higher risk” than WaMu’s existing 
subprime loan portfolio.726

725  OTS also determined that Long Beach’s newly created 

   

Nevertheless, in December 2005, OTS examiners wrote that, even though Long Beach 

was “engaged in a high-risk lending activity and we are not yet fully satisfied with its practices,” 
727  
they recommended approving WaMu’s purchase of the company with certain conditions.
Those conditions included WaMu’s reconsidering its high risk lending concentration limits, 
including “stated income loans with low FICOs and high LTV ratios”; WaMu’s assurance that 
Long Beach would comply with certain loan guidance; a WaMu commitment to continue to 
bring down its loan exception and error rates; and a WaMu commitment to ensure its Enterprise 
Risk Management division would provide a “countervailing balance” to “imprudent” desires to 
expand Long Beach’s subprime lending.728

 

About the same time as this memorandum was completed, OTS learned that, during the 

fourth quarter of 2005, Long Beach had been required to repurchase tens of millions of dollars of 
loans it had sold to third parties due to early payment defaults.
  By December, this unexpected 
wave of repurchases had overwhelmed Long Beach’s repurchase reserves, leading to a reserve 
shortfall of nearly $75 million.  Altogether in the second half of 2005, Long Beach had to 
repurchase loans with about $837 million in unpaid principal, and incurred a net loss of about

poor quality loans, inadequate repurchase reserves, and negative earnings impact on its parent

Beach.  OTS explained its decision to the Subcommittee by contending that the change in status 
gave WaMu more control over Long Beach to ensure its improvement.731

 

WaMu ultimately purchased Long Beach on March 1, 2006.

Beach’s practices did not improve, but continued to exhibit numerous problems, as described in 
the prior chapter.  A May 2006 OTS examination of Long Beach loans concluded, for example, 
“that the number and severity of underwriting errors noted remain at higher than acceptable 
levels.”733

concerns remaining 6 months later.”

(e)  Over 500 Deficiencies in 5 Years   

195 

As part of their review of Washington Mutual, the Treasury and the FDIC Inspectors 

General determined that, over a five-year period, 2004-2008, OTS examiners identified a total of 
over 540 criticisms, observations, and recommendations related to WaMu operations.737  At the 
Subcommittee hearing, when asked whether those 540 findings constituted “serious criticisms” 
of the bank, Treasury IG Eric Thorson responded:  “Absolutely.”738
General, Jon Rymer, agreed: 

  The FDIC Inspector 

“[T]he examiners, from what I have seen here, were pointing out the problems, 
underwriting problems, riskier products, concentrations, distributions, and markets that 
may display more risk – they were all significant problems and they were identified.  At 
the end of the day, though, I don’t think forceful enough action was taken.”

739

 

As WaMu accumulated hundreds of infractions from OTS, longstanding problems with 

asset quality in the bank’s portfolio continued.  While some observers have blamed WaMu’s 
failure on its liquidity troubles in late 2008, years of unresolved problems festered below the 
surface. 

The consequences of WaMu’s failure to address its underwriting problems, risk 

 
concentrations, risk layering, and other problems were exponential increases in its loss rates.  
The FDIC later calculated the loss rates for several WaMu products.  In WaMu’s held-for-
investment Option ARM portfolio, delinquency rates nearly doubled every year, rising from 
0.48% at the end of 2005 to 0.90% a year later, to 2.63% at year end 2007, and up to 4.63% by 
June 30, 2008.740  In its subprime portfolio, its delinquency rate increased from 7.39% in 2005 to 
25.20% in June 2008.741  The delinquency rate in its HELOC portfolio rose from 0.58% in 2005 
to 4.00% in June 2008.742  As a result, net charge-offs for WaMu’s Option ARM portfolio rose 
from $15 million at year end 2005 to $37 million in 2006, to $147 million in 2007, and to $777 
million by June 2008.743  HELOC net charge-offs likewise increased, rising from $21 million in 
2005, to $23 million in 2006, to $424 million in 2007, and to $1.19 billion by June 2008.744  
Subprime net charge-offs expanded even more rapidly, rising from $47 million in 2005, to $134 
million in 2006, to $550 million in 2007, and $956 million by June 2008.745  To account for 
these losses, WaMu’s loss provisions jumped from $218 million in 2006 to over $2 billion in 
2007, and an additional $6 billion by June 2008.746

The joint report of the Treasury and the FDIC Inspectors General specifically identified 
WaMu’s poor quality loans and poor risk management practices as the real cause of its failure, 
rather than the liquidity crisis that hit the bank in 2008.747  During the Subcommittee’s hearing, 
when asked why WaMu failed, a senior FDIC official put it this way:  “Asset quality.  Weak 
asset quality.  It brought on the liquidity problems.”748

  He explained:  

“If you have strong asset quality, you will not have liquidity issues because your assets – 
you can borrow either against them or you can sell them.  If you have weak asset quality, 
then you are going to have liquidity issues at some point.”
 
 (4)  OTS Turf War Against the FDIC 

749

  

As WaMu approached the end, tensions between OTS and the FDIC that had built up 

over two years evolved into a turf war.  OTS examination and regional officials began to express 
distrust of their FDIC counterparts.  The conflict was elevated to the top leaders of both agencies, 
who came to take different views of what to do with WaMu – the FDIC becoming more 
aggressive and OTS becoming more protective.  When the bank’s imminent collapse was no 
longer a question, the result was a hasty seizure and sale.  Had the two government agencies 
acted in concert, rather than as adversaries, it is likely that WaMu’s problems would have been 
resolved earlier and with less collateral damage.  During an interview, the chairman of the FDIC, 
Sheila Bair, stated pointedly that WaMu “could have sold themselves in July if they had 
tried.”750
other options remained, and OTS worked with the FDIC to make it happen. 

  The same outcome was not accomplished until two months later in September when no 

As mentioned earlier, OTS was the primary, but not the only, federal bank regulator that 
oversaw Washington Mutual.  Since WaMu was also an insured institution, the FDIC served as a 
backup examiner responsible for evaluating the risk that the bank posed to the Deposit Insurance 
Fund.  Because WaMu was one of the eight largest insured institutions in the country, the FDIC 
had assigned a Dedicated Examiner whose full time responsibility was to determine whether the 
bank was operating in a safe and sound manner.  The FDIC Examiner reviewed all OTS ROEs 
and examination findings, participated on many occasions in OTS examinations, and reviewed 
bank documents.  The FDIC reviewed the CAMELS ratings for the bank, as well as LIDI ratings 
under its Large Insured Depository Institutions Program. 

For many years, FDIC examiners worked cooperatively with OTS examiners to conduct 
oversight of WaMu.  But beginning in 2006, OTS management expressed increasing reluctance 
to allow FDIC examiners to participate in WaMu examinations and review bank documents.  
Claiming that joint efforts created confusion about which agency was WaMu’s primary

197 

 OTS officials employed a variety of tactics to limit the FDIC oversight of the bank, 

regulator,751
including restricting its physical access to office space at the bank, its participation in bank 
examinations, and its access to loan files.  In addition, as the FDIC began to express greater 
concern about the bank’s viability, recommend ratings downgrades, and urge enforcement 
action, OTS officials displayed increasing resistance to its advice.  In the end, OTS not only 
undermined years of cooperative oversight efforts, but at times actively impeded FDIC oversight 
of one of the largest insured banks in the country.      

Resisting FDIC Advice.  During the period 2004-2008, internal FDIC evaluations of 

Washington Mutual were consistently more negative than those of OTS, at times creating friction 
between the two agencies.  OTS also resisted the FDIC’s advice to subject WaMu to stronger 
enforcement actions, downgrade its CAMELS rating, and solicit buyers for the bank.   

As early as 2005, the FDIC examination team expressed concerns about WaMu’s high 
risk lending strategy, even though the bank’s management expressed confidence that the risks 
were manageable.  In an internal memorandum, for example, the FDIC team identified multiple 
negative impacts on WaMu’s loan portfolio if housing prices were to stop climbing.  The 
memorandum stated in part: 

“Washington Mutual Bank’s (WMB) single-family residential (SRF) loan portfolio has 
embedded risk factors that increase exposure to a widespread decline in housing prices.  
The overall level of risk is moderate, but increasing. …  A general decline in housing 
prices would adversely impact: a) The SRF loan portfolio; b) The home equity loan 
portfolio; and c) Mortgage banking revenue. …  In January 2005, management developed 
a higher-risk lending (HRL) strategy and defined company-wide higher-risk loans as … 
sub prime loans … SFR loans with FICO scores below 620, … consumer loans with 
FICO scores below 660, and … [the] Long Beach … portfolio.  Management intends to 
expand the HRL definition and layer additional risk characteristics in the future. …  
Management acknowledges the risks posed by current market conditions and recognizes 
that a potential decline in housing prices is a distinct possibility.  Management believes, 
however that the impact on WMB would be manageable, since the riskiest segments of 
production are sold to investors, and that these investors will bear the brunt of a bursting 
housing bubble.”752

 

                                                      
751 See, e.g., April 16, 2010 Subcommittee Hearing at 61 (testimony of OTS Director Reich: “[F]irst of all, the 
primary regulator is the primary Federal regulator, and when another regulator enters the premises, when the FDIC 
enters the premises, confusion develops about who is the primary regulator, who really is calling the shots, and who 
do we report to, which agency.”) 
752 Undated draft memorandum from the WaMu examination team at the FDIC to the FDIC Section Chief for Large 
Banks, FDIC-EM_00251205-10, Hearing Exhibit 4/16-51a (likely mid-2005).  In an interview, when shown the 
draft memorandum, FDIC Assistant Regional Director George Doerr, who was a member of the WaMu examination 
team, told the Subcommittee that this type of analysis was prepared for a select group of mortgage lenders, including 
WaMu, to understand where the mortgage market was headed and how it would affect those insured thrifts.  He did 
not have a copy of the final version of the memorandum, but said the FDIC’s analysis was discussed with OTS.  
Subcommittee interview of George Doerr (3/30/2010).   

198 

In mid-2005, an internal FDIC memorandum discussed the increased risk associated with 

the new types of higher risk mortgage loans being issued in the U.S. housing market:  

“Despite the favorable history, we believe recent lending practices and buyer 
behavior have elevated the risk of residential lending.  Concerns are compounded 
by significantly increased investor activity and new loan products that allow less 
creditworthy borrowers to obtain mortgages.  The new loan products of most 
concern include Option Adjustment Rate Mortgage (ARM) Loans, Interest Only 
(IO) Loans, and Piggyback Home Equity Loans.”753

 

WaMu offered all three types of loans, in addition to subprime loans through Long 
Beach. 

In 2007, an FDIC memorandum again identified WaMu’s high risk home loans as 

its “primary risk,” singling out both its subprime and Option ARM loans: 

“SFR [Single Family Residential loan] credit risk remains the primary risk.  The 
bank has geographic concentrations, moderate exposure to subprime assets, and 
significant exposure to mortgage products with potential for payment shock. …   
The bank’s credit culture emphasized home price appreciation and the ability to 
perpetually refinance. …  In the past, the bank relied on quarterly sales of 
delinquent residential loans to manage its non performing assets.  The bank’s 
underwriting standards were lax as management originated loans under an 
originate to sell model.  When the originate to sell model collapsed in July 2007 
for private and subprime loans, management was no longer able to sell non 
performing assets.  Consequently, non performing assets are now mounting, and 
the bank’s credit risk mitigation strategy is no longer effective.”754

     

From 2004 to 2008, the FDIC assigned LIDI ratings to WaMu that indicated a higher 

degree of risk at the bank than portrayed by the bank’s CAMELS ratings.  LIDI ratings are 
intended to convey the degree of risk that a bank might cause loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund, 
755  The FDIC IG explained the difference between 
with A being the best rating and E the worst.
LIDI and CAMELS ratings as follows:  “LIDI ratings consider future risks at an institution, 
where CAMELS rating, in practice, are more point-in-time measures of performance.”756

early as 2004, the FDIC viewed WaMu as having higher levels of risk than indicated by its 
CAMELS ratings.  This chart shows the comparable ratings over time:

FDIC IG Rymer explained that the B/C rating meant that the FDIC viewed WaMu as posing a 
“somewhat more than ordinary risk” to the Deposit Insurance Fund, the C rating meant it “posed 
more than an ordinary risk,” D meant the FDIC had “a high level of concern,” and E meant that 
the FDIC had “serious concerns” that WaMu would cause a loss to the Fund.758

   

 

 

Despite assigning lower LIDI ratings to the bank, indicating the increasing risk it posed 
 
to the Deposit Insurance Fund, the FDIC – like OTS – continued to support a 2 CAMELS rating 
throughout 2007.  The result of both regulators delaying a downgrade in WaMu’s rating had a 
direct impact on FDIC operations.  According to the FDIC Inspector General, WaMu’s 
CAMELS rating of 2 prevented the FDIC from charging higher premiums for the Deposit 
Insurance Fund until February 2008, when its rating was dropped to a 3.
  Higher premiums are 
one of the tools used by the FDIC to signal to financial institutions that they should better control 
their risk.  Unfortunately, in this case, that tool was not available in 2005, 2006, or 2007. 

759

OTS downgraded the bank to a 3 CAMELS rating in February 2008, after WaMu 

incurred substantial losses.  OTS also required WaMu to issue a nonpublic Board Resolution 
making general commitments to strengthen its operations.  The FDIC undertook a special 
insurance examination of the bank, analyzed its capital, and concluded that the bank should raise

additional capital.760  The FDIC staff attempted to engage OTS staff in discussions about 
increasing the bank’s capital and downgrading its CAMELS ratings, but OTS was not 
persuaded.761

 

In July 2008, tensions between the FDIC and OTS flared after the FDIC sent a letter to 

OTS urging it to take additional enforcement action:  “As we discussed, we believe that 
[WaMu’s] financial condition will continue to deteriorate unless prompt and effective 
supervisory action is taken.”
included requiring the bank to raise $5 billion in additional capital and provide quarterly reports 
on its financial condition.  OTS not only rejected that advice, but also expressed the hope that the 
FDIC would refrain from future “unexpected letter exchanges.”763
Polakoff, a senior OTS official called the FDIC letter “inappropriate and disingenuous”:   

762  The letter urged OTS to impose a “corrective program” that 

  In a separate email, Scott 

“I have read the attached letter from the FDIC regarding supervision of Wamu and am 
once again disappointed that the FDIC has confused its role as insurer with the role of the 
Primary Federal Regulator.  Its letter is both inappropriate and disingenuous.  I would 
like to see our response to the FDIC, which I assume will remind it that we, as the PFR, 
will continue to effectively supervise the entity and will continue to consider the FDIC’s 
views.”

764

 

Two weeks later, on July 31, both OTS and the FDIC met with the WaMu Board of 
Directors to discuss the bank’s problems.  At that meeting, the FDIC Dedicated Examiner 
suggested that the bank look for a “strategic partner” who could buy or invest in the bank.  The 
OTS director, John Reich, later expressed anger at the FDIC for failing to clear that suggestion 
first with OTS as the bank’s primary regulator.  An FDIC examiner wrote to his colleagues:   

“Major ill will at WAMU meeting yesterday caused by FDIC suggestion in front of 
WAMU management that they find a strategic partner.  [OTS Director] Reich reportedly 
indicated that was totally inappropriate and that type of conversation should have 
occurred amongst regulatory agencies before it was openly discussed with 
management.”765
The next day, on August 1, 2008, due to WaMu’s increasing financial and deposit losses, 
the FDIC Chairman, Sheila Bair, suggested that the bank’s condition merited a downgrade in its 
CAMELS rating to a 4, signaling a troubled bank.
  The head of OTS sent an email to the head 
of the FDIC responding that “rating WaMu a 4 would be a big error”:    

766

 

“In my view rating WaMu a 4 would be a big error in judging the facts in this situation.  
It would appear to be a rating resulting from fear and not a rating based on the condition

of the institution.  WaMu has both the capital and the liquidity to justify a 3 rating.  It 
seems based on email exchanges which have taken place that FDIC supervisory staff in 
San Francisco is under pressure by the fear in Washington to downgrade this institution.  
… [P]rior to such action I would request a[n FDIC] Board meeting to consider the proper 
rating on this institution.”767

 

The FDIC Chairman responded: “We will follow the appropriate procedures if the staff cannot 
agree.”

768

 

 

A few days later, Ms. Bair sent an email to Mr. Reich requesting a discussion of 

“contingency planning” for WaMu, including making “discrete inquiries” to determine whether 
any institution would be willing to buy the bank.  The OTS Director responded with a lengthy 
email criticizing the request and stating in part: 

 

“I do not under any circumstances want to discuss this on Friday’s conference call ….  I 
should not have to remind you the FDIC has no role until the PFR [Primary Federal 
Regulator] (i.e. the OTS) rules on solvency ….  You personally, and the FDIC as an 
agency, would likely create added instability if you pursue what I strongly believe would 
be a precipitous and unprecedented action.  …  It seems as though the FDIC is behaving 
as some sort of super-regulator – which you and it are not.”769
In September 2008, Ms. Bair informed WaMu that there was a likely ratings 

  

disagreement between the FDIC and OTS, and that the FDIC intended to lower the bank’s rating 
to a 4.  After the FDIC Chairman informed the OTS Director by email of her conversation with

come to him first with that information:  “I cannot believe the continuing audacity of this 
woman.”

Restricting Office Space and Information.  Throughout the period examined by the 

Subcommittee, OTS not only rebuffed the FDIC’s analysis and advice, it began to actively 
impede FDIC oversight efforts at WaMu.  OTS even went so far as to limit the FDIC’s physical 
access to office space, as well as to needed information, at WaMu’s new headquarters.  Prior to 
2006, OTS had always provided the FDIC examiners with space in its on-site offices at the bank, 
making it easy for FDIC examiners to participate in OTS examinations.  In the summer of 2006, 
however, following WaMu’s move to a new headquarters in Seattle, OTS did not provide any of 
its desks for the FDIC examiners.  OTS also restricted the FDIC’s access to an important 
database that all examiners used to review WaMu documents, referred to as the “examiner’s 
library.”  From July until November 2006, a period of about four months, the FDIC examiners 
were denied access to both office space on the bank’s premises and the examiner’s library.  The

FDIC had to make multiple requests, taking the issue up through the OTS hierarchy in 
Washington, D.C. headquarters, to regain the access it had enjoyed for years at WaMu. 

In an October 2006 email to the FDIC Assistant Regional Director, George Doerr, the 

FDIC Dedicated Examiner at WaMu, described in exasperation how he had been promised 
permanent space at the bank, but still did not have it.  Demonstrating how poisoned the 
relationship was at that point, the FDIC examiner blamed the lack of cooperation on “stalling 
tactics and misrepresentations:” 

“Our issue is with OTS management (Finn and Dochow) and how they have apparently 
mislead RD [Regional Director] Carter, DRD [Deputy Regional Director] Villalba, you, 
and me.  This regards space for the dedicated examiner and access to information ….  I 
met with OTS examiners yesterday and they have not made arrangements for permanent 
space for me at the new location and protocols for information sharing have not been 
developed ….  In July RD Carter [from FDIC] talked with Finn [from OTS] and he 
agreed to space and access.  On 8/17 you and DRD Villalba had a telephone conversation 
with Dochow and he agreed it was not necessary to fix what was not broken and he 
promised access to space and information.  On 9/15 I met with Dochow and he agreed to 
space and information sharing ….  I am prepared for more of Dochow’s stalling tactics 
and misrepresentations.”771

 

Mr. Doerr forwarded the “info about OTS denying us space and access to information” to other 
FDIC officials stating:  “The situation has gone from bad to worse.”

772

 

At the Subcommittee hearing, when asked why OTS took four months to restore FDIC 

access to office space and WaMu documents, Mr. Doerr of the FDIC responded: 

Mr. Doerr:  I can’t explain what the reason was.  I personally think they didn’t want us 
there.  I mean, we were denied physical access and the access to this examiner library … 
of electronic materials that WaMu puts together for the regulators …. [Y]ou shouldn’t 
have to go 4 months without having to have that. … 

Senator Levin:  And it was essential that Mr. Funaro [the FDIC Dedicated Examiner] 
have access to that library in order to get information about the Washington Mutual? 
Mr. Doerr:  Absolutely.773

 

By November 2006, when OTS relented and provided desk space and database access to 
the FDIC Dedicated Examiner, it did little to ameliorate the situation.  Its actions contributed to a

worsening relationship between the two agencies, impeded FDIC oversight efforts, and 
weakened oversight of WaMu’s activities.774

  

Restricting FDIC Examinations.  At the same time OTS was withholding office space 
and database access from the FDIC examination team, it also, for the first time, refused an FDIC 
request to participate in an OTS examination of WaMu.   

Although the FDIC has a broad statutory right to participate in examinations of insured 

depository institutions,775 it had agreed to spell out how it would exercise that statutory authority 
in a 2002 Interagency Agreement with the Federal Reserve, OCC, and OTS.776  The Interagency 
Agreement authorized the FDIC to conduct “special examinations” of insured institutions that 
“represent a heightened risk” to the Deposit Insurance Fund, defined as institutions with a 3, 4, 
or 5 rating on the CAMELS scale or which were “undercapitalized as defined under Prompt 
Corrective Action” standards.777
  Other FDIC bank examinations had to be authorized by the 
primary regulator.  Prior to 2006, OTS had routinely authorized joint OTS-FDIC examinations 
without regard to the CAMELS ratings, but in January 2006, OTS suddenly changed its policy.  
The change was signaled in an email sent by a senior OTS official to his colleagues:   

“The message was crystal clear today.  Absolutely no FDIC participation on any OTS 1 
and 2 rated exams. . . . We should also deny FDIC requests to participate on HC [holding 
company] or affiliate exams. 

Permission for FDIC to join us on WaMu … will stand for now, but they should not be 
[in] direct contact with thrift management or be requesting info directly from the 
thrift.”778

   

This email signaled the beginning of a much more restrictive policy toward the FDIC 
participation in OTS examinations, even though in January 2006, OTS indicated it would allow 
an exception for the FDIC examiners to continue participating in its scheduled examination of 
WaMu.  The reasons for this change in policy were never made clear, but in several interviews, 
OTS and FDIC officials attributed it to certain senior OTS officials who were reluctant to share 
thrift oversight responsibilities with the FDIC. 

In August 2006, the FDIC made what it viewed as a routine request to join in the next 

OTS examination of WaMu, which was designed to focus, in part, on WaMu’s subprime lending.  
To the surprise and consternation of the FDIC, the OTS Regional Director Michael Finn sent a 
letter denying the request and stating that OTS would instead “share our exam findings with the

FDIC, as we have in the past.”779
and FDIC had not shown “any concerns regarding our past or planned examination activities, 
and our continued commitment to share all appropriate information, the FDIC has not shown the 
regulatory need to participate in the upcoming Washington Mutual examination.” 

  Mr. Finn wrote that because WaMu’s CAMELS rating was a 2 

After discussing the Finn letter in an internal email, the FDIC Assistant Regional 

Director, George Doerr, wrote to his colleagues: 

“Obviously, we have a major problem here.  OTS is taking the approach we need to 
establish a ‘regulatory need to participate’ on an exam, and that the basis would have to 
be disagreement on exam findings.  Mr. Finn is totally missing the point on our need for 
timely accurate information to properly categorize WAMU for deposit insurance 
premium purposes, more so now than ever in the past.”780

 

In October 2006, John Carter with the FDIC sent Michael Finn of OTS a letter repeating 

the FDIC’s request to participate in the WaMu examination:   

“I have received your response to our August 14 2006 letter in which we request 
permission to participate in aspects of the upcoming examination of Washington Mutual 
Bank.  Regarding your reasoning for rejecting our participation in these target reviews, 
you are correct that our request is not predicated on any current disagreement related to 
examination findings or concerns regarding supervisory activities at Washington Mutual.  
Such criteria are not prerequisite for requesting – or for the OTS granting – FDIC staff 
participation in target examination activities. 

As you are aware, the FDIC and the OTS have a long, cooperative, and productive 
working relationship with respect to the examination of Washington Mutual Bank, which 
we hope to continue.  Past experience has proven that our participation in targeted 
reviews is beneficial to our respective Agencies, as well as to the Bank. …  The 2002 
Agreement clearly allows for FDIC staff participation in examination activities to 
evaluate the risk of a particular banking activity to the deposit insurance fund.   

Washington Mutual Bank is very large insured financial institution, and in our view 
participation on the upcoming targeted reviews is necessary to fulfill our responsibilities 
to protect the deposit insurance fund.”781

 

On November 10, 2006, Mr. Finn responded with a letter that, again, refused to allow the 

FDIC to participate in the WaMu examination: 

“OTS does not seek to have FDIC staff actively participate in our examination activities 
and conclusions at Washington Mutual.  We do understand your need for access to

examination information and your need to meet with OTS staff to discuss our supervisory 
activities at Washington Mutual.  To facilitate this information sharing and discussions, 
we have agreed to allow your Dedicated Examiner … to conduct his FDIC risk 
assessment activities on site at Washington Mutual when our examination team is on site.  
All FDIC requests for information should continue to be funneled through our examiner-
in-charge.”782

 

The OTS letter also restricted the ability of the FDIC to place more than one examiner on site at 
WaMu, even though the bank, with $300 billion in assets, was one of the largest insured 
institutions in the country and was engaged in a high risk lending strategy: 

“We also understand that the FDIC may occasionally request OTS permission to have 
FDIC examination staff assist [its Dedicated Examiner] on site at Washington Mutual in 
his risk assessment activities.  We will consider these limited requests to send additional 
FDIC staff to Washington Mutual on a case-by-case basis.”783

 

Despite the negative tone of the OTS letter, the FDIC persisted in its request, and OTS 

eventually allowed the FDIC examiners to participate in some WaMu examinations in 2006 and 
2007, though it continued to press the FDIC to limit its requests and personnel.

   

784

During the Subcommittee hearing, the FDIC staff described their surprise at the new OTS 

policy and frustration at its seemingly circular reasoning – that the FDIC needed to specify a 
“basis” and “disagreement” with OTS to justify joining an OTS examination, but the FDIC was 
also barred from participating in the very examinations that could develop that basis and 
disagreement.

   

785

Restricting Access to Loan Files.  Even after OTS reluctantly allowed the FDIC to 

participate in some OTS examinations, it held firm in its refusal to allow the FDIC to directly 
review WaMu loan files, insisting that the FDIC instead rely on the findings and conclusions of 
OTS examiners who conducted the loan file reviews. 

In September 2006, when OTS first refused to give the FDIC direct access to WaMu loan 

files, an FDIC senior official commented:  “The OTS must really be afraid of what we might 
come across, but bottom line is we need access to the information.”786
the Subcommittee that it needed direct access to the loan files to assess the higher risk loans 
WaMu was issuing, both to evaluate what insurance fees should be imposed on Washington 
Mutual and to assess the extent of any threat to the Deposit Insurance Fund.

In February 2007, OTS refused an FDIC request to review WaMu loan files to evaluate 

the bank’s compliance with recently issued federal guidance on how to handle nontraditional 
mortgages, such as subprime, stated income, and negatively amortizing loans.  Even though 
Washington Mutual was issuing exactly those types of loans under its High Risk Lending 
Strategy, OTS indicated that it did not plan to evaluate WaMu’s compliance with the guidance 
and did not want the FDIC to perform that evaluation either.  In a February email, the FDIC 
Dedicated Examiner at WaMu informed the FDIC Assistant Regional Director:  “OTS is 
restricting FDIC on the current examination in the SFR [single family residential loan] review 
segment.  OTS will not allow us to review SFR loan files.”787  The Assistant Regional Director 
relayed the development to the Regional Director:  “John, here we go again.  …  OTS wants to 
draw a distinction between loan file review as an examination activity (that they object to) vs. 
risk assessment (which they do not object to).  I don’t fathom the distinction.”788

 

Two months later, in April 2007, the FDIC continued to press for permission to review 

WaMu loan files.  The FDIC Assistant Regional Deputy wrote in an email to a colleague: 

“[OTS Regional Director] Finn pushed back on his previous approval of our participation 
in the 2007 exam targets, specifically as to our ability to work loan files alongside OTS 
examiner, and we were particularly interested in WAMU’s compliance with 
nontraditional mortgage guidance. ... Mr. Finn and his examiner, Ben Franklin, stated that 
OTS did not intend to look at files for purposes of testing nontraditional mortgage 
guidance until after the bank made a few changes they had agreed to.  I asked if we could 
then join the file review whenever ots did look at this, and he said, ‘No.’”789

   

At the Subcommittee hearing, when asked about these incidents, the FDIC Chairman 

Sheila Bair testified: 

 “[I]n 2005 … OTS management determined that FDIC should not actively participate in 
OTS examinations at WaMu, citing the 2002 interagency agreement.  In subsequent 
years, FDIC faced repeated resistance to its efforts to fully participate in examinations of 
WaMu.  Even as late as 2008, as problems at WaMu were becoming more apparent, OTS 
management sought to limit the number of FDIC examiners involved in the examination 
and did not permit the FDIC to review loan files.”790

 

Both the Treasury and the FDIC Inspectors General were critical of OTS’ actions.  In response to 
a question about “[w]hether or not OTS should have allowed the FDIC to help” with the 
examinations of WaMu, FDIC IG Rymer responded: 

“[I]t is clear to me that they [OTS] should have.  …  [T]hey [the FDIC] had concerns and 
those concerns were principally driven by its own LIDI analysis. … [T]here is no 
question in my mind that the FDIC’s request for back-up authority, simply given the

sheer size of WaMu, was, to me, enough reason for FDIC to ask for back-up 
authority.”791

 

Treasury IG Thorson agreed: 

“I agree with Mr. Rymer.  …  [T]he sheer size of the bank would say that there should be 
a maximum of cooperation, not to mention the fact that it is dictated by statute, as well.  
… [A]s a matter of policy, I think they [OTS] should have allowed that.  No matter what 
their reasoning was, as a matter of policy, they should have, yes.”792
OTS Turf War.  At the Subcommittee hearing, John Reich, the OTS Director, was asked 

 

 

about the friction between the two agencies.  In response to a question about the August 2008 
email in which he wrote that the FDIC had “no role” at WaMu until OTS “rules on solvency,”
Mr. Reich stressed that the key point he was trying to convey was that OTS was WaMu’s 
primary federal regulator: 

793

 

Mr. Reich:  I think basically and fundamentally it was who was the primary Federal 
regulator. 

Senator Levin:  It was turf, in a word. 

Mr. Reich:  I think OTS had the responsibility as the primary Federal regulator. 

Senator Levin:  Turf.  

Mr. Reich:  We had the statutory responsibility. 

Senator Levin:  Instead of going at this as partners – 

Mr. Reich:  I have more than most – an understanding of the role of the FDIC and their 
need to participate.  I have been there.794
The evidence shows that OTS senior officials not only resisted, but resented the FDIC 

 

participation in the oversight of Washington Mutual Bank and deliberately took actions that 
limited the FDIC oversight, even in the face of a deteriorating $300 billion institution whose 
failure could have exhausted the entire Deposit Insurance Fund.  After contrasting OTS’ hard-
edged treatment of the FDIC with the collaborative approach it took towards WaMu, Senator 
Levin observed: 

“About the only time OTS showed backbone was against another agency’s moving, in 
your view, into your turf.  Boy, that really got your dander up.  That got your blood 
pressure up.  I do not see your blood pressure getting up against a bank which is engaged

in the kind of dangerous practices that the bank engaged in, dangerous to their solvency, 
dangerous to their investors, dangerous to their depositors, dangerous to this 
economy.”795

  

Because OTS has been abolished, its turf war with the FDIC is over.  But witnesses from 
the FDIC told the Subcommittee that the remaining banking regulators also sometimes resist its 
participation in bank oversight.  In particular, a senior FDIC official told the Subcommittee that, 
although the FDIC has the statutory authority to take an enforcement action against a bank, the 
FDIC has never used that authority because the other regulators would view it as “an act of war.”  
The WaMu case history demonstrates how important it is for our federal regulators to view each 
other as partners rather than adversaries in the effort to ensure the safety and soundness of U.S. 
financial institutions. 

D.  Regulatory Failures  

In a market economy, the purpose of regulation within the financial markets is to provide 

a level playing field that works for everyone involved, from the financial institutions, to the 
investors, to the consumers and businesses that rely on well functioning financial systems.  When 
financial regulators fail to enforce the rules in an effective and even handed manner, they not 
only tilt the playing field in favor of some and not others, but also risk creating systemic 
problems that can damage the markets and even the entire economy.   

At the April 16, 2010 hearing of the Subcommittee, Senator Coburn had the following 

exchange with Inspectors General Thorson and Rymer, which explains in part why OTS failed as 
a regulator to address WaMu’s harmful lending policies: 

Senator Coburn:  As I sat here and listened to both the opening statement of the Chairman 
and to your statements, I come to the conclusion that actually investors would have been 
better off had there been no OTS because, in essence, the investors could not get behind 
the scene to see what was essentially misled by OTS because they had faith the regulators 
were not finding any problems, when, in fact, the record shows there are tons of 
problems, just there was no action taken on it. ... I mean, we had people continually 
investing in this business on the basis—as a matter of fact, they raised an additional $7 
billion before they collapsed, on the basis that OTS said everything was fine, when, in 
fact, OTS knew everything was not fine and was not getting it changed.  Would you 
agree with that statement or not? 

Mr. Thorson:  Yes, sir.  I think ... basically assigning a ‘satisfactory’ rating when 
conditions are not is contradictory to the very purpose for which regulators use a rating 
system.  I think that is what you are saying. 

Senator Coburn: Any comments on that Mr. Rymer? 

Mr. Rymer:  I would agree with Mr. Thorson.  ...  

                                                      
795 Id. at 66. 

209 

Senator Coburn:  [To Mr. Thorson] By your statement, it would imply almost that OTS is 
an enabler of this effort rather than an enabler of making sure that the American people’s 
taxpayer dollars and the trust in institutions that are supposed to be regulated by an 
agency of the Federal Government can be trusted. 

Mr. Thorson: Right. 

In trying to understand why OTS failed to make use of its enforcement tools to compel 

WaMu to operate in a safe and sound manner, the Subcommittee investigation has identified 
factors that have resonance not only in the recent financial crisis, but are critical for regulators 
and policymakers to address in order to avoid future financial disasters as well. 

 (1)  OTS’ Failed Oversight of WaMu 

During the five-year period of the Subcommittee’s inquiry, from 2004 to 2008, OTS 

identified over 500 serious operational deficiencies at WaMu and Long Beach.  At WaMu, the 
problems included weak lending standards, high loan exception and error rates, noncompliance 
with bank loan policy, weak risk management, poor appraisal practices, and poor quality loans.  
At Long Beach, OTS identified many of the same problems and added on top of those, weak 
management, poor quality mortgage backed securities, and inadequate repurchase reserves.  The 
problems are described in examination report after examination report, and OTS raised many of 
the same concerns, in writing and in person, with WaMu’s Board of Directors. 

But for all those years, OTS did little beyond describing the problems and asking bank 

executives to make improvements.  When the reforms failed to materialize, the problems 
continued, and the risk increased, OTS stood on the sidelines.  Subcommittee interviews found 
that, until 2008, OTS regulators never even held internal discussions about taking an 
enforcement action against the bank.  In 2008, in the face of mounting losses, OTS took two 
informal, nonpublic enforcement actions, which contained few mandatory measures or deadlines 
and were together insufficient to save the bank. 

In trying to understand the agency’s years of inaction, the Subcommittee’s investigation 

concluded that the lack of enforcement reflected an OTS culture of deference to bank 
management, demoralized examiners whose oversight efforts were unsupported by their 
supervisors, and a narrow regulatory focus that allowed short term profits to excuse high risk 
activities and disregarded systemic risk.  Inflated CAMELS ratings may have further reduced the 
pressure to act, while conflicts of interest may have also tempered OTS’ willingness to take 
tough enforcement action against WaMu. 

 (a)  Deference to Management 

Part of the reason that OTS declined to take enforcement action against Washington 

Mutual was a posture of deference to the management of the institutions it regulated.  Ronald 
Cathcart, WaMu’s chief enterprise risk officer from 2006-2008, described OTS as essentially 
believing in “self-regulation”: 

210 

“I … have actually operated in banks under three regulators, in Canada under the Office 
of the Supervisor of Financial Institutions, at Bank One under the OCC, and then at 
Washington Mutual under the OTS[.] … [T]he approach that the OTS took was much 
more light-handed than I was used to.  It seemed as if the regulator was prepared to allow 
the bank to work through its problems and had a higher degree of tolerance that I had … 
seen with the other two regulators. …  I would say that the OTS did believe in self-
regulation.”796

 

A former OTS regulator who later took a job with WaMu, was quoted in a press report as saying 
that OTS provided “by far the softest” oversight of any federal bank regulator.

797

 

Evidence of OTS’ unusually deferential approach can be found in its internal documents, 

starting at the top.  In a May 2007 email, for example, cancelling lunch with a colleague so he 
could instead have lunch with WaMu’s CEO, Kerry Killinger, OTS Director, John Reich, 
described the bank as “my largest constituent.”
defended using the term, testifying that referring to others as constituents was a “habit” he had 
picked up while working on Capitol Hill.799  One Senator pointed out that OTS’ true constituents 
were not the banks it regulated, but “the American people it was supposed to protect from unsafe 
and unsound banking practices.”800

798  At the Subcommittee hearing, Mr. Reich 

 

On another occasion in July 2008, Mr. Reich sent an email to Mr. Killinger informing 

him that OTS had decided to issue a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to address issues of 
concern at the bank.  In the email, the OTS Director apologized twice for his method of 
communication, but also sounded a note of regret for his decision to take a tougher approach: 

“Kerry, 

I’m sorry to communicate by email – I’ve left a couple of messages on your office phone, 
but I’m guessing you may be off for a long weekend. 

I’ve been wrestling with the issue of an MOU versus a Board Resolution as a result of 
our conversation in my office last week.  And I’ve decided that an MOU is the right 
approach for OTS to do in this situation …. 

We almost always do an MOU for 3-rated institutions, and if someone were looking over

be surprised if they learn of it, and would probably only be surprised to learn one didn’t 
already exist.

the office next week myself and wanted you to have this information.

The email does not convey a message from an arms-length regulator concerned about a 

failing bank.  To the contrary, the email conveys a sense of familiarity and discloses that the 
head of OTS knew his agency had already been providing preferential treatment to the bank by 
failing to impose an MOU after its downgrade to a 3 rating five months earlier, in February 
2008.  Mr. Reich stated that others “looking over our shoulders … would probably be surprised” 
an MOU was not already in place at WaMu.   

When asked about this email at the Subcommittee hearing, the Treasury and the FDIC 

Inspectors General both expressed discomfort with its language and tone: 

Mr. Thorson:  Again, he sort of apologizes in the previous document that this could 
become known.  This gets right to the heart of what you were talking about, the culture. 
…  [T]here is not an acceptance of the fact that a strong regulatory control helps them.  

Senator Levin:  This is far too cozy? 

Mr. Thorson:  Absolutely, as far as I am concerned, yes. 

Senator Levin:  Mr. Rymer, do you have any reaction to this? 
Mr. Rymer:  It does indicate a level of familiarity that makes me uncomfortable.802

  

Equally telling is the fact that, even after sending the email, OTS delayed imposing the MOU on 
WaMu for another two months, waiting until September 2008, just three weeks before the bank’s 
failure.

   

803

Like the head of the agency, OTS examiners also took a deferential approach to WaMu.  

 
In a January 2006 email discussing WaMu’s desire to purchase Long Beach, for example, the 
OTS Examiner-in-Charge indicated that, rather than insist the bank clean up Long Beach

212 

problems before the purchase, OTS would have to rely on its “relationship” with WaMu to get 
the job done:  

“The letter [from WaMu] seems okay.  They obviously want to leave it a little squishy, of 
course, on the growth plans, but at least they make a firm commitment to clean up the 
underwriting issues.  At some level, it seems we have to rely on our relationship and their 
understanding that we are not comfortable with current underwriting practices and don’t 
want them [Long Beach] to grow significantly without having the practices cleaned up 
first.”804
On another occasion in June 2006, the same OTS Examiner-in-Charge sent a lengthy 
email to his Regional Director discussing plans for the annual WaMu Report on Examination 
(ROE).  His email expressed concern about losing credibility with the bank if OTS pressed too 
hard on certain reforms, twice noted the bank’s size and complexity, and stressed that the bank 
was making progress in fixing identified problems: 

 

“[W]e still have some strong feelings on some items that I’d like to ‘push back’ … some 
on.  Generally we feel that we are quite balanced and do not have any gloves on in our 
approach to our findings and conclusions at WAMU.  We have some concern that if we 
press forward with some things …  we may run the risk of losing some credibility in 
terms of understanding the size and complexity of their business and looking as though 
we do not have a balanced perspective.  My own fear is that we may not have done 
enough to communicate to you [the Regional Director] why we feel that the few negative 
things we have brought up through findings memos and meetings, while important to 
keep in front of management, are not so serious they wipe out all the right things the 
institution is doing in all those areas we reviewed and did not have any issues, nor should 
they negate the ongoing good progress in making improvements in a manner that seems 
reasonable given the size, complexity, and status of the institution.”805
The Examiner-in-Charge then listed three areas of concern, problems at Long Beach 
which he seemed to downplay, the need to limit the number of corrective actions listed in the 
ROE, and the need to review how OTS cited the bank for compliance violations.  In the Long 
Beach discussion, he wrote that improvements “will take time because of size and complexity 
….  We don’t feel demanding more than providing us with an acceptable action plan with 
realistic timelines is appropriate or necessary at this time.”  On the corrective actions, he wrote 
that the list had to be limited or “more important findings will get lost. …  We feel strongly that 
we should not cite all findings and corrective actions within the body of the ROE … [which] is 
already not getting read I believe.”  He also expressed concern that OTS was “starting to ‘over-
meeting’ the institution” and suggested that “the exit meeting” with the bank to discuss the ROE 
findings had “become almost unnecessary.”

213 

After urging patience on WaMu reforms, suggesting a limit on the corrective actions 

listed in the ROE, and recommending fewer meetings with WaMu management, the curious final 
line in the email is:  “My management class this week has made me feel empowered!  Can you 
tell?  Please don’t fire me!” 

Additional evidence of OTS deference is its reliance on WaMu to track its own 

compliance with OTS findings calling for corrective action.  At all other thrifts, OTS tracked the 
extent to which the thrift implemented OTS findings, using its own systems.  But at WaMu, OTS 
did not keep its own records, but relied on WaMu’s Enterprise Risk Issue Control System 
(ERICS).  The Treasury and the FDIC Inspectors General criticized this arrangement, noting that 
they were unable to use WaMu’s system to determine the status of multiple OTS findings.806  In 
addition, they noted that, in 2006, ERICS discontinued its practice of identifying “repeat 
findings,” making it difficult to identify and track those findings.807
recommends against OTS’ relying on a bank’s systems in the future to track compliance. 

  Their report explicitly 

Finally, the actual language used by OTS in its reports and memoranda that described 
deficiencies demonstrated a passive approach to dealing with management.  Common phrases 
noted that the bank’s practices were “less than satisfactory,” error rates were at “higher than 
acceptable levels,” and “management’s actions did not improve underwriting to a satisfactory 
level.”  OTS reports rarely used more assertive language that, for example, called the bank’s 
efforts unsatisfactory, inadequate, or ineffective.  An exchange at the Subcommittee hearing 
between Senator Levin and the OTS Examiner-in-Charge at WaMu from 2004 to 2006, 
Lawrence Carter, captured the issue: 

Mr. Carter:  I think that what I said here is that we could not conclude that their progress 
was wholly inadequate, because they did make some progress. 

Senator Levin: …  Can you use the words, ‘Folks, your progress was inadequate?’ Are 
you able to tell them that? 

Mr. Carter:  For their progress on this specific action plan, I did not conclude we could 
tell them that. 

Senator Levin:  That it was inadequate? 

Mr. Carter:  That is right. 

Senator Levin:  You could tell them it was not wholly adequate. 

Mr. Carter:  Yes. 

Senator Levin:  But not inadequate. 

Mr. Carter:  I do not think I could say it was wholly inadequate. 

                                                      
806 See, e.g., IG Report at 30. 
807 See Thorson prepared statement, April 16, 2010 Subcommittee Hearing at 12. 

214 

Senator Levin:  I did not use the word ‘wholly.’  You could tell them it was not wholly 
adequate, but you could not tell them it was inadequate.  That is what you are telling us. 

Mr. Carter:  Yes. 

Senator Levin:  That is the kind of bureaucratic speech which I think sends the message 
to people you regulate that, hey, folks, you are making progress, instead of telling them it 
is inadequate.808

 

At times, WaMu took advantage of its special relationship with OTS and lobbied for 
leniency.  In one instance from May 2006, a WaMu official from the Regulatory Relations 
division sent an email to his colleagues stating that he was able to convince the agency to reduce 
an audit “criticism” to the less serious category of a “recommendation”:   “OTS confirmed today 
809  His 
that they will re-issue this memo without the ‘Criticism.’ It will be a ‘Recommendation.’”
colleague forwarded the email to bank executives noting:  “Good news - John was able to get the 
OTS to see the light and revise the Underwriting rating to a Recommendation.”810

  

A more serious incident involved WaMu’s 2005 discovery, after almost a year-long 

investigation by an internal Home Loans Risk Mitigation Team, of substantial loan fraud taking 
place at two high volume loan offices in California, known as Downey and Montebello.  The 
WaMu investigators found that 83% of the loans reviewed from the Downey office and 58% of 
the loans reviewed from the Montebello office contained fraudulent information, either with 
respect to the borrower or the appraised value of the property.  The investigators wrote up their 
811
findings and presented them to WaMu’s Chief Risk Officer and the President of Home Loans.
No one, however, informed OTS, and WaMu took no action to stop the fraudulent loans. 

  

Two years later, in 2007, after a mortgage insurer refused to insure any more loans issued 
by the lead loan officer in the Montebello office, OTS directed WaMu to investigate the matter.  
WaMu’s internal auditors launched an investigation, confirmed the loan fraud problem at the 
Montebello office, and also uncovered the 2005 investigation whose fraud findings had been 
  WaMu 
ignored.  WaMu took until April 2008 to produce a report documenting its findings.
also initially resisted providing the report to OTS, claiming it was protected by attorney-client

privilege.813
  The OTS Examiner-in-Charge at the time told the Subcommittee that he insisted on 
seeing the report.  After finally receiving it and reading about the substantial loan fraud occurring 
at the two loan offices since 2005, he told the Subcommittee that it was “the last straw” that 
ended his confidence that he could rely on WaMu to combat fraudulent practices within its own 
ranks.  

OTS’ deference to WaMu management appeared to be the result of a deliberate posture 
of reliance on the bank to take the steps needed to ensure that its personnel were engaged in safe 
and sound practices.  The reasoning appeared to be that if OTS examiners simply identified the 
problems at the bank, OTS could then rely on WaMu’s own self interest, competence, and 
discipline to ensure the problems were corrected, with no need for tough enforcement action.  It 
was a regulatory approach with disastrous results.  While OTS may have hoped that it could 
accomplish its regulatory responsibilities by simply identifying problems without the threat of 
enforcement action, that approach proved ineffective.     

(b) Demoralized Examiners 

For five years, OTS examiners identified serious problems with WaMu’s lending 

practices and risk management, but OTS senior officials failed to support their efforts by using 
the agency’s enforcement tools to compel the bank to correct the identified problems.  WaMu’s 
chief risk officer from 2004 to 2005, James Vanasek, remarked at the Subcommittee hearing on 
how OTS examiners seemed to receive little support from more senior officials in terms of 
enforcement: 

“[T]he OTS Examiner-in-Charge during the period time in which I was involved … did 
an excellent job of finding and raising the issues.  Likewise, I found good performance 
from … the FDIC Examiner-in-Charge.  …  What I cannot explain is why the superiors 
in the agencies didn’t take a tougher tone with the banks given the degree of … negative 
findings.  My experience with the OTS, versus with the OCC, was completely different.  
So there seemed to be a tolerance there or a political influence on senior management of 
those agencies that prevent them from taking a more active stance.  By a more active 
stance, I mean putting the banks under letters of agreement and forcing change.”814
 

Internal OTS documents and emails indicate that the result was a cadre of OTS examiners who 
were skeptical of their ability to effect meaningful change at WaMu, who were too often 
rebuffed by their own management when they tried to reduce risk or strengthen bank controls, 
and whose leaders worked to weaken rather than strengthen the standards used by examiners to 
hold banks accountable.

216 

Low Expectations.  The documents show that OTS examiners had low expectations that 

WaMu would actually implement recommended changes at the bank.  Ultimately, OTS 
examiners adapted to the situation, they gave up trying to make the bank act more quickly, and 
WaMu was able to delay needed changes for long periods of time if it wished.   

In 2003, for example, one OTS examiner wrote to the Examiner-in-Charge: 

“It is clear from my experience that changes seem to progress slowly at WaMu so I don’t 
know if we can expect faster progress ….  If any target is missed, as happens at WaMu, 
then we may not be in a position to determine the effectiveness of the corrective 
actions.”815

 

In 2005, another OTS examiner wrote:  “They agree to take all action required to correct the 
problem.  The Target Completion Dates are not real timely but fine for WaMu.”

   

816

Other examiners were more critical.  In 2007, for example, one OTS examiner wrote: 
“Regulatory Relations [the WaMu office established to work with regulators] is a joke. 
The purpose of this group seems to be how can we give the regulators the bare minimum 
without them raising a fuss.”817

 

The examiner also wrote: 

“WaMu’s compliance management program has suffered from a lack of steady, 
consistent leadership. Dick Stevenson, who took over as Chief Compliance Officer on 
March 2, 2007, is the bank’s ninth compliance leader since 2000.  …  The OTS is very 
concerned that this lack of consistent, stable leadership leaves the program vulnerable. 
This amount of turnover is very unusual for an institution of this size and is a cause for 
concern.  The Board of Directors should commission an evaluation of why smart, 
successful, effective managers can’t succeed in this position. If you would like my 
opinion, just ask. (HINT: It has to do with top management not buying into the 
importance of compliance and turf warfare and Kerry [Killinger] not liking bad 
news.)”818
In an interview, OTS examiner Benjamin Franklin, who worked at the agency for 24 

   

 
years, told the Subcommittee that the thrifts he oversaw generally did not “collaborate” with the 
agency but would “fight” OTS reviews and resist OTS recommendations.  He said that at WaMu,

217 

“for the most part” OTS examiners were “butting heads” with bank personnel and it was difficult 
to effect change.819

  

Weak Standards.  The documents show that the OTS examiners were also frustrated by 
the agency’s weak standards, which made it difficult to cite WaMu for violations or require the 
bank to strengthen its operations.   

In 2007, for example, an examiner critical of WaMu’s compliance procedures wanted to 
downgrade the bank’s compliance rating from 2 to 3, but told the OTS Examiner-in-Charge that, 
due to the lack of standards on compliance matters, she didn’t believe she could win a battle with 
the bank: 

“I’m not up for the fight or the blood pressure problems.  …  It doesn’t matter that we are 
right, what matters is how it is framed.  …  They [Washington Mutual] aren’t interested 
in our ‘opinions’ of the [compliance] program.  They want black and white, violations or 
not. …  [O]ur training always emphasizes ‘Best Practices’ but when it comes down to it, 
we don’t have the resources to show the risk.”820
At another point, when discussing standards for calculating acceptable loan error rates, an 

   

OTS examiner wrote:   

“We will need additional discussion of acceptable error rates and how we view their 
[WaMu’s] standard.  … [A] 2.5 percent error rate would mean that approximate[ly] 
$600.0 million could be originated and be within acceptable guidelines.  A 20.0 percent 
medium error rate means that $4.8 billion of loans with these types of errors could be 
originated without a criticism.  The latter seem[s] especially high when you consider that 
their medium criteria includes loans that we don’t think should be made.”821

 

The OTS Examiner-in-Charge responded with a lengthy email criticizing outdated, unclear OTS 
standards on the acceptable loan error rate for a portfolio of subprime loans: 

“Unfortunately, our sampling standards are 10 years old and we have no standards of 
acceptance really.  It depends on our own comfort levels, which differ. …  Moreover, our 
guidance requires that an exception be SIGNIFICANT, which ... we have over time 
interpreted as loans that should not have been made. …  While we may (and have) 
questioned the reasonableness of these standards, they are all we have at this time.  If our 
tolerance for some reason is now a lot lower than our handbook standards, it would be 
nice to have this clarified.  I have always used these standards as rough benchmarks and 
not absolutes myself, upping my expectations for higher risk portfolios.  …  It would be

nice if they [higher risk loan portfolios] could meet even higher expectations, but that 
would require us to agree on what the standard should be.”822
At another point, the same Examiner-in-Charge wrote a long email discussing issues 
related to a decision by WaMu to qualify borrowers for adjustable rate mortgages using an 
interest rate that was less than the highest rate that could be charged under the loan.  He  
complained that it was difficult to force WaMu to comply with the OTS “policy of underwriting 
at or near the fully indexed rate,” when “in terms of policy, I am not sure we have ever had a 
really hard rule that institutions MUST underwrite to the fully indexed rate.”
  He also noted 
that OTS sometimes made an exception to that rule for loans held for sale. 

823

 

NTM Guidance.  While some OTS examiners were complaining about the agency’s 
weak standards, other OTS officials worked to ensure that new standards being developed for 
high risk mortgages would not restrain WaMu’s lending practices.  The effort began in 2006 with 
an aim to address concerns about lax lending standards and the risks posed by subprime, 
negatively amortizing, and other exotic home loans.  The federal banking agencies convened a 
joint effort to reduce the risk associated with those mortgages by issuing interagency guidance 
for “nontraditional mortgage” products (NTM Guidance).  Washington Mutual filed public 
comments on the proposed NTM Guidance and argued that Option ARM and Interest-Only loans 
were “considered more safe and sound for portfolio lenders than many fixed rate mortgages,” so 
824  It also stated that 
regulators should “not discourage lenders from offering these products.”
calculating a potential borrower’s “DTI [debt-to-income ratio] based on the potential payment 
shock from negative amortization would be highly speculative” and “inappropriate to use in 
lending decisions.”825  During subsequent negotiations to finalize that guidance, OTS argued for 
less stringent lending standards than other regulators were advocating and bolstered its points 
using data supplied by Washington Mutual.826

   

In one July 2006 email, for example, an OTS official expressed the view that early 

827  He also wrote that OTS needed to 

  In August, several OTS officials discussed over email how to prevent the 

versions of the new guidance focused too much on negative amortization loans, which were 
popular with several thrifts and at WaMu in particular, and failed to also look closely at other 
high risk lending products more common elsewhere.
address this issue and “should consider going on the offensive, rather than defensive to refute the 
OCC’s positions” on negatively amortizing loans, defending the loans using WaMu Option 
ARM loan data.828

proposed restrictions on negatively amortizing loans from going farther than they believed 
necessary, noting in part the “profitable secondary market” for Option ARMs and the fact that 
“hybrid IO [interest only] ARMs are a huge product for Wamu.”  One OTS official wrote:   

“We have dealt with this product [negatively amortizing loans] longer than any other 
regulator and have a strong understanding of best practices.  I just don’t see us taking a 
back seat on guidance that is so innate to the thrift industry.”829

  

OTS officials argued variously that the new proposal would wrongly put the focus on 
“products” instead of “underwriting,” as well as that it would hurt the business of large thrifts 
like WaMu.

830

  

The NTM Guidance was finally issued on October 4, 2006.

  The final version did not 
fully reflect the recommendations of OTS on negatively amortizing loans.  Among other matters, 
it called on banks to: 

831

•  evaluate a borrower’s ability to fully repay a prospective loan, including any balance 

increase from negative amortization;  

•  qualify borrowers using the higher interest rate that would apply after any teaser or 

introductory interest rate;  

•  avoid loans whose repayment was dependent solely upon the value of the collateral or 

the borrower’s ability to refinance the loan; and  

• 

implement strong quality control and risk mitigation procedures for loans containing 
layers of risk, including loans with no documentation requirements, no verification of 
the borrower’s income or assets, or high loan-to-value ratios.   

The Guidance also called for capital levels commensurate with risk and adequate allowances for 
loan losses.   

The Guidance was not promulgated as a bank regulation that could be enforced in court, 

and it contained no explicit deadline for compliance.  Instead, it provided policies and procedures 
that regulators could use as benchmarks during examinations.  Agencies could penalize 
noncompliance with the standards through lower CAMELS ratings or enforcement actions.

have to comply with the new standards.832

A few days after the NTM Guidance went into effect, WaMu officials met with OTS 

about implementation and reported back that OTS had indicated that compliance was something 
833  According to a written summary by 
institutions “should” do, not something they “must” do.
WaMu of its October 12, 2006 meeting with OTS to discuss the new rules, OTS told the bank 
that it “view[ed] the guidance as flexible” and “specifically pointed out that the language in the 
guidance says ‘should’ vs. ‘must’ in most cases and they [were] looking to WaMu to establish 
our position on how the guidance impacts our business processes.”834

 

In 2007, OTS conducted a review of WaMu’s Option ARM activities and compliance 

efforts and found that three months after the NTM Guidance had become effective, the bank was

noted that as of January 31, 2007, the bank had a total of $62 billion in outstanding Option 
ARMs in its investment portfolio, of which 80% were negatively amortizing.836  The review 
stated that, as of December 31, 2006, WaMu was not in compliance with the NTM Guidance, 
because it continued not to consider potential negative amortization amounts when qualifying 
borrowers for Option ARMs; placed too much reliance on FICO scores instead of income 
verification to qualify borrowers for nontraditional mortgages; failed to consider amortizing 
payments or payment shocks when qualifying borrowers for interest only loans; and placed too 
much reliance on collateral, rather than borrower income, as the primary repayment source in the 
event of a loan default.837
WaMu changed its procedures. 

  The review contained no recommendations for actions to ensure

contacted OTS official Mike Finn about the FDIC’s request to review WaMu loan files to test 
NTM compliance, Mr. Finn said that OTS was giving its institutions more time to comply with 
the guidance, even though it had taken effect more than six months earlier.840  The FDIC 
Chairman Sheila Bair told the Subcommittee that the FDIC had not known until then that OTS 
was allowing institutions to delay compliance with the NTM Guidance and were “surprised” by 
the agency’s actions.  She said that normally, if an institution needs more time to comply with 
new standards, a regulator required it to provide a written plan with milestones for achieving 
compliance.841

 

Documents uncovered by the Subcommittee show how WaMu took advantage of the 

delay to continue its high risk lending practices.  The NTM Guidance directed banks, for 
example, to evaluate a borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage using the highest interest rate that 
would be charged under the loan and the fully amortized payment amount rather than any 
smaller or minimum payment amount.  After determining that those new requirements could lead 
to a 33% drop in Option ARM loan volume due to borrowers who would no longer qualify for 
the loans, WaMu’s Chief Enterprise Risk Officer, Ron Cathcart, advised “holding off on 
implementation until required to act for public relations (CFC [Countrywide] announces 
unexpectedly) or regulatory reasons.”
had already allowed Washington Mutual to delay its compliance with the Guidance for six 
months, resulting in the bank’s originating billions of dollars in new Option ARM loans that 
would later suffer significant losses.843
strengthen WaMu’s lending standards and reduce its loan risk, OTS chose to delay its 
implementation. 

842  When he made that suggestion in March 2007, OTS 

  Instead of using the NTM Guidance as an opportunity to 

In addition, in May 2007, when an OTS official attempted to stop WaMu from issuing 

mortgages without verifying borrower incomes, relying on the NTM Guidance and other rules as 
justification, OTS senior management rebuffed the official’s efforts.  Instead, OTS senior 
managers interpreted its standards as allowing thrifts to continue issuing “stated income loans,” 
also called “No Income No Asset” (NINA) or “no doc” loans, because they permitted lenders to 
provide credit without verifying the borrower’s income or assets.  On May 15, 2007, after 
reviewing a summary of WaMu’s loans, an OTS official in Washington, Bill Magrini, sent an 
email to the OTS Examiner-in-Charge with responsibility for WaMu stating: 

“I note that WAMU makes a significant amount of No-doc loans.  OTS policy states that 
no-doc loans are unsafe and unsound.  I assume they mean no doc regarding NINA or no 
income-no asset loans.

Without even asking for income or assets/liabilities, the loans are collateral-dependent.  
This is imprudent …  [T]he interagency NTM Guidance states specifically that collateral 
dependent loans are unsafe and unsound. …   
 
Does WAMU have any plans to amend its policies per no doc loans?”844
The Examiner-in-Charge, Benjamin Franklin, relayed the inquiry to the then Director of 
the OTS Western Region Office, Darrel Dochow, and stated that, while WaMu had not issued 
“true NINAs” in the past, the bank had begun “doing NINA’s in 2006 through their conduit 
program.  As such, all these loans are held for sale.”  He estimated WaMu then had about $90 
million of NINA loans held for sale, had originated about $600 million in 2006, and would 
originate the same amount again in 2007.

845

  

 

Mr. Dochow responded that he was already in regular contact with OTS officials in 

Washington about WaMu and “there is no need to duplicate with Bill Magrini as far as I 
know.”

  Later the same day, Mr. Dochow wrote:   

846

“I am being told that Bill’s views may not necessarily represent OTS policy in these 
matters.  I value Bill’s input, but we should be careful about relaying his views to others 
as being OTS policy, absent collaborating written guidance.  [His] views … are 
somewhat inconsistent with NTM guidance and industry practice.  I also understand 
Grovetta [another OTS official] promised to clarify section 212 of the handbook in 
several areas as a result of the NTM roundtable discussion in Wash DC last month.”

847

 

That same day, another OTS official, Mark Reiley, sent an email indicating his belief that 

sections of the OTS handbook barred WaMu from issuing NINA loans, even when those loans 
were originated for sale to Wall Street: 

“The Handbook guidance Section 212 states that no-doc loans (NINAs) are unsafe and 
unsound loans (Pg. 212.7).  Furthermore, even if the no-doc (NINA) loans are originated 
and held for sale the guidance indicates (pg. 212.8) the association must use prudent 
underwriting and documentation standards and we have already concluded they are 
unsafe and unsound.  Even if the institution holds the loans for a short period of time. …

industry.  …  At this point I don’t think a memo is the best avenue, I think we need to 
request in writing that WAMU respond to us on how the NINA’s comply with the 
handbook guidance?” 

The WaMu Examiner-in-Charge, Benjamin Franklin, responded: 

“I didn’t intend to send a memo until I got a blessing from [the Western Region Director] 
or DC on what our official policy is on this. …  [M]any of our larger institutions now do 
NINAs (including Countrywide) .… Apparently [OTS policy official] Bill Magrini is the 
lone ranger in his view that NINA’s are imprudent.  West region position seems to be that 
FICO, appraisal, and other documentation … is sufficient to assess the borrower’s ability 
to repay in all but subprime loans.  While I probably fall more into the Magrini camp 
(until we get empirical data to support NINAs are not imprudent) we will just document 
our findings … until the ‘official’ policy on this has been worked out.”848
A year later, in October 2008, after WaMu’s failure, the same Examiner-in-Charge, 

 

Benjamin Franklin, wrote to a colleague:   

“[N]ot one regulatory agency had a rule or guideline saying you couldn’t do stated 
income lending, even to this day.  That, I find incredible.  We criticized stated income 
lending at WaMu but they never got it completely fixed.  … [I]n hindsight, I’m 
convinced that it is just a flawed product that can’t be fixed and never should have been 
allowed in the first place.  How do you really assess underwriting adequacy when you 
allow the borrower to tell you what he makes without verification.  We used to have 
documentation requirements for underwriting in the regs, but when those were taken out, 
the industry slowly migrated to an anything goes that got us into this mess. …  When I 
told Scott Polakoff [OTS Deputy Director] that stated income subprime should not be 
made under any circumstance, I was corrected by Mike Finn [OTS Western Region head] 
that that was not the West Region’s position.  I rest my case.”849
Data compiled by the Treasury and FDIC Inspectors General shows that, by the end of 

 

2007, stated income loans – loans in which the bank did not verify the borrower’s income – 
represented 50% of WaMu’s subprime loans, 73% of its Option ARMs, and 90% of its home 
equity loans.

had identified serious deficiencies at the bank year after year, with no enforcement 
consequences; some tried to interpret OTS standards in ways that would reduce risk, only to be 
rebuffed by their leaders; and others were told that the NTM Guidance being enforced by other 
agencies did not have standards that could be enforced by OTS examiners.  Days after WaMu’s 
failure, one OTS examiner had this to say about OTS leadership: 

“My examination history here is filled with the editing and removal of my comments as 
well as predictions (that turned out to be true) by EICs [Examiners-in-Charge].  No 
system in place to keep that from happening.  Instead we put whitewashers and scaredity 
cats in charge of the most problematic shops.  I don’t know what happened to you at 
WAMU, but I was critical of their accounting at Card Services and the AP.  Fortunately, I 
think I made the ‘don’t let him come back here’ list. … [O]ur leadership screwed us and 
can’t acknowledge it.  They should resign.”853
(c)  Narrow Regulatory Focus  

 

In addition to a policy of deference to management, weak standards, and demoralized 
examiners, OTS employed an overly narrow regulatory focus that allowed WaMu’s short term 
profits to excuse its risky practices and that ignored systemic risk.  For a time, its short term 
profits masked the problems at Washington Mutual, and regulators allowed practices which they 
knew to be risky and problematic to continue.  Because it mishandled its responsibilities, OTS 
gave the illusion to investors, economists, policy makers, and others that the bank was sound, 
when in reality, it was just the opposite.  Unfortunately, the truth of the matter was not revealed 
until it was too late, and the bank collapsed. 

Using Short Term Profits to Excuse Risk.  OTS justified not taking enforcement action 

against WaMu in part by pointing to Washington Mutual’s profits and low loss rates during the 
height of the mortgage boom, claiming they made it difficult to require the bank to reduce the 
risks threatening its safety and soundness.  In 2005, when faced with underwriting problems at 
WaMu, the OTS Examiner-in-Charge put it this way: 

“It has been hard for us to justify doing much more than constantly nagging (okay, 
‘chastising’) through ROE [Reports of Examination] and meetings, since they [WaMu] 
have not been really adversely impacted in terms of losses.  It has been getting better and 
has not recently been bad enough to warrant any ratings downgrade.”854

 

The OTS Handbook was explicit, however, in stating that profits should not be used to 

overlook or excuse high risk activities:

225 

“If an association has high exposure to credit risk, it is not sufficient to demonstrate that 
the loans are profitable or that the association has not experienced insignificant losses in 
the near term.”855

   

But in the case of Washington Mutual, profits did make a difference.  At the 

Subcommittee hearing, when asked by Senator Kaufman to identify one or two reasons why no 
regulatory action was taken against WaMu, the FDIC IG Jon Rymer testified as follows: 

“[L]et me start by saying I think the problem in 2005, 2006, and into 2007, the problem 
was the bank was profitable.  I think there was a great reluctance to [take action], even 
though problems were there in underwriting, the product mix, the distribution process, 
the origination process, all in my view extraordinarily risky .…  [T]he people in [agency] 
leadership positions have to be willing to make the tough calls and be experienced 
enough to know that today’s risky practices may show today profitability, but to explain 
to management and enforce with regulatory action that risky profitability is going to have 
a cost.  It either has a cost in control processes an institution would have to invest in now, 
or it is going to have a cost ultimately to the bank’s profitability and perhaps eventually 
to the Deposit Insurance Fund.”856

  

In his prepared statement, the Treasury Inspector General, Eric Thorson, noted 

 
that OTS examiners told his staff they did not lower WaMu’s CAMELS ratings because 
“even though underwriting and risk management practices were less than satisfactory, 
WaMu was making money and loans were performing.”

    

857

This problem was not isolated within OTS, however, but applied to other regulatory 

agencies as well.  The FDIC Inspector General noted, for example, that the bank’s profitability 
also tempered the FDIC views of the bank.  He explained that, prior to 2008, the FDIC did not 
challenge WaMu’s 2 CAMELS ratings, because “the risks in WaMu’s portfolio had not 
manifested themselves as losses and nonperforming loans, and therefore did not impact WaMu’s 
financial statements.”
long list of “embedded risk factors” in WaMu’s home loans that, despite the bank’s profitability, 
exposed the bank to losses in the event of “a widespread decline in housing prices.”859

858  At the same time, an internal FDIC analysis of the bank identified a 

   

In the financial industry, high risk activities are undertaken by financial institutions to 

earn higher marginal returns.  The role of the regulator is to enforce rules that ensure the risks an 
institution undertakes do not unfairly transfer that risk to others or threaten the safety and 
soundness of the economy, despite any short term profits.  In the case of the FDIC, the judgment

includes whether the risk threatens loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund.  Any firm that decides to 
take a risk should be the only firm, along with its investors, to bear the brunt of the problem if it 
turns out to have been a mistake.  Regulators that, when faced with short term profits, stop 
evaluating or downplay attendant risks that could produce later losses fail in their obligation to 
ensure the safety and soundness of the financial institutions they are regulating.  In the case of 
WaMu, both OTS and the FDIC allowed the bank’s success in the short term to paper over its 
underlying problems.    

In October 2008, after Washington Mutual failed, the OTS Examiner-in-Charge at the 

bank, Benjamin Franklin, deplored OTS’ failure to prevent its thrifts from engaging in high risk 
lending because “the losses were slow in coming”: 

“You know, I think that once we (pretty much all the regulators) acquiesced that stated 
income lending was a reasonable thing, and then compounded that with the sheer insanity 
of stated income, subprime, 100% CLTV [Combined Loan-to-Value], lending, we were 
on the figurative bridge to nowhere.  Even those of us that were early opponents let 
ourselves be swayed somewhat by those that accused us of being ‘chicken little’ because 
the losses were slow in coming, and let[’]s not forget the mantra that ‘our shops have to 
make these loans in order to be competitive’.  I will never be talked out of something I 
know to be fundamentally wrong ever again!!”860

     

Failure to Consider Financial System Impacts.  A related failing was that OTS took a 
narrow view of its regulatory responsibilities, evaluating each thrift as an individual institution 
without evaluating the effect of thrift practices on the financial system as a whole.  The U.S. 
Government Accountability Office, in a 2009 evaluation of how OTS and other federal financial 
regulators oversaw risk management practices, concluded that none of the regulators took a 
systemic view of factors that could harm the financial system: 

“Even when regulators perform horizontal examinations across institutions in areas such 
as stress testing, credit risk practices, and the risks of structured mortgage products, they 
do not consistently use the results to identify potential system risks.”861

   

Evidence of this narrow regulatory focus includes the fact that OTS examiners carefully 
evaluated risk factors affecting home loans that WaMu kept on its books in a portfolio of loans 
held for investment, but paid less attention to the bank’s portfolio of loans held for sale.  OTS 
apparently reasoned that the loans held for sale would soon be off WaMu’s books so that little 
analysis was necessary.  From 2000 to 2007, WaMu securitized about $77 billion in subprime

loans, mostly from Long Beach, as well as about $115 billion in Option ARM loans.862
documents indicate that OTS did not consider the problems that could result from widespread 
defaults of poorly underwritten mortgage securities from WaMu and other thrifts.   

  Internal 

Numerous documents show that OTS and the FDIC were, in fact, aware that WaMu was 

issuing high risk loans that led to poor quality securitizations: 

2005 OTS email describing poor quality Long Beach mortgage backed securities:  
“Performance data for 2003 and 2004 vintages appear to approximate industry average 
while issues [of securities] prior to 2003 have horrible performance. ...  [Long Beach] 
finished in the top 12 worst annualized [net credit losses] in 1997 and 1999 thru 2003.  …  
At 2/05, [Long Beach] was #1 with a 12% delinquency rate.  Industry was around 
8.25%.”863
2005 FDIC analysis of WaMu high risk loans:  “Management acknowledges the risks 
posed by current market conditions and recognizes that a potential decline in housing 
prices is a distinct possibility.  Management believes, however that the impact on 
[WaMu] would be manageable, since the riskiest segments of production are sold to 
864
investors, and that these investors will bear the brunt of a bursting housing bubble.”

2005 OTS email discussing allowing lower standards for loans held for sale:  “[L]oans 
held for sale could be underwritten to secondary market standards ….  I believe we would 
still find that secondary market requirements are more lax than our policy on 
underwriting to fully indexed rates.  …  [I]f you allow them [WaMu] the exception for 
loans held for sale … they probably do not have a ton of loans that fall far outside our 
policy guidance.”
2006 OTS email discussing Long Beach loans that had to be repurchased from buyers:  
“The primary reasons for the problem were … [g]eneral lower quality 2005 production 
due to economy and lowered standards ….  The $4.749 billion in loans on [Long Beach] 
books at 12/31/05 are largely comprised of the same 2005 vintage production that was 
sold in the whole loan sales and are now subject to the increased repurchases. …  
Management is balancing the probability that these loans will perform worse than 
expected and priced for, versus the increased income they generate … in considering 
whether to [sell] some or all of the portfolio.”

2008 OTS email after WaMu’s failure:  “We were satisfied that the loans were originated 
for sale.  SEC and FED [were] asleep at the switch with the securitization and 
repackaging of the cash flows, irrespective of who they were selling to.”867

 

2005 WaMu audit of Loan Sales and Securitization planned no further audit for three 
years.  In March 2007, OTS informally suggested that more frequent audits would be 
appropriate given the high volume and high risk nature of WaMu’s securitization activity 
and “data integrity issues surrounding the creation of securitization trusts, resulting in 
loan repurchases from those trusts.”

Neither OTS nor the FDIC saw preventing WaMu’s sale of high risk mortgages into U.S. 
securitization markets as part of its regulatory responsibilities. 

(d)  Inflated CAMELS Ratings 
Still another possible explanation for OTS’ inaction may have been the overly positive 

CAMELS ratings it assigned WaMu.  From 2004 until early 2008, WaMu held a 2 rating, which 
meant that it was “fundamentally sound,” had “satisfactory risk management,” and had “only 
moderate weaknesses that [were] within the board’s and management’s capability and 
willingness to correct.”869

WaMu.

“[W]e find it difficult to understand how OTS could assign WaMu a satisfactory asset 
quality 2-rating for so long.  Assigning a satisfactory rating when conditions are not 
satisfactory sends a mixed and inappropriate supervisory message to the institution 
and its board.  It is also contrary to the very purpose for which regulators use the 
CAMELS rating system.”

Inspector General Thorson also criticized the 2 rating assigned to WaMu’s management, 

which signaled “satisfactory performance by management and the Board of Directors and

rating until June 2008, despite the bank’s ongoing failure to correct the many deficiencies 
identified by OTS examiners and the fact that management problems at WaMu were 
longstanding.  At the Subcommittee hearing, the FDIC Inspector General Rymer also criticized 
the 2 rating assigned to WaMu’s management:   

  He noted that OTS gave management this positive 

“[T]he management piece should be, in my view, downgraded if management has not 
demonstrated that it has built the adequate systems and control processes and 
governance processes to help manage problems when they eventually do occur in 
assets. …  I find it difficult to understand why the management rating at a minimum 
was not lowered much earlier on.”

873

 

The FDIC Inspector General also noted that, from 2004 to 2008, the FDIC had assigned 

LIDI ratings to WaMu that indicated a higher degree of risk at the bank than portrayed by the 
bank’s CAMELS ratings.  He observed that LIDI ratings, which are intended to convey the 
degree of risk that a bank might cause loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund, are designed to be 
more forward-looking and incorporate consideration of future risks to a bank, as compared to 
CAMELS ratings, which are designed to convey the state of an institution at a particular point in 
time.

   

874

WaMu kept its 2 rating despite the five-year litany of lending, risk management, 

appraisal, and Long Beach deficiencies identified by OTS examiners from 2004 to 2008.  It was 
only in February 2008, after the bank began to incur substantial losses, that OTS downgraded the 
bank to a 3.  When the FDIC urged a further downgrade to a 4 rating in the summer of 2008, 
OTS disagreed.  In September 2008, however, while still resisting the ratings downgrade, OTS 
acknowledged internally that WaMu’s poor quality loans and poor risk management were the 
source of its problems:  

“The bank’s overall unsatisfactory condition is primarily the result of the poor 
asset quality and operating performance in the bank’s major Home Loans 
Group area of business. …  The deteriorating asset quality in the Home Loans 
Group is accompanied by inadequacies in risk management, internal controls, 
and oversight that made more vulnerable to the current housing and economic 
downturn.  The examination criticized past liberal home loan underwriting 
practices and concentrated delivery of nontraditional mortgage products to 
higher risk geographic markets.”875

 

It was only on September 18, 2008, after the bank began to run out of the cash needed to 
conduct its affairs and the FDIC independently downgraded the bank to a 4, that OTS 
finally agreed to the downgrade.  One week later, OTS placed the bank into receivership.

Hindsight establishes that the CAMELS ratings assigned to Washington Mutual 
Bank were inflated.  Whether the ratings inflation was attributable to the OTS culture of 
deference to management, examiners who were too intimidated to downgrade the 
agency’s largest institution, an overly narrow regulatory focus that was blinded by 
WaMu’s short term profits and ignored systemic risk, or an absence of forward-looking 
risk analysis, the WaMu collapse suggests that the CAMELS rating system did not work 
as it should.  

  

(e)  Fee Issues 

During the investigation, when asked why OTS senior officials were not tougher on 

Washington Mutual Bank, several persons brought up the issue of fees – that WaMu supplied 
$30 million or nearly 15% of the fees per year that paid for OTS’ operating expenses.  WaMu’s 
former Chief Risk Officer James Vanasek offered this speculation: 

“I think you have to look at the fact that Washington Mutual made up a substantial 
portion of the assets of the OTS and one wonders if the continuation of the agency would 
have existed had Washington Mutual failed.”876

 

The issue was also raised by Treasury IG Thorson who warned that OTS should have been “very 
clear from top to bottom” that WaMu’s payment of $30 million in fees per year to OTS was “not 
a factor.  It just [was] not.”

   

877

The OCC and OTS are the only federal banking regulators reliant on fees paid by their 
regulated entities to fund their operations.  At OTS, Washington Mutual was far larger than any 
other thrift overseen by the agency and was a far larger and more important contributor to the 
agency’s budget.  It is possible that the agency’s oversight was tempered by recognition of the 
thrift’s unique importance to the agency’s finances and a concern that tough regulation might 
cause WaMu to convert its charter and switch to a different regulator.  Its dependence on WaMu 
fees may have given OTS the incentive to avoid subjecting WaMu to regulatory enforcement 
actions and ultimately compromised its judgments. 

 
Conclusion.  WaMu is the largest bank failure in the history of the United States.  When 

OTS seized it, WaMu had $307 billion in assets.  By comparison, the next largest U.S. bank 
failure was Continental Illinois, which had $40 billion in assets when it collapsed in 1984.  OTS’ 
failure to act allowed Washington Mutual to engage in unsafe and unsound practices that cost 
borrowers their homes, led to a loss of confidence in the bank, and sent hundreds of billions of 
dollars of toxic mortgages into the financial system with its resulting impact on financial markets 
at large.  Even more sobering is the fact that WaMu’s failure was large enough that, if the bank 
had not been purchased by JPMorgan Chase, it could have exhausted the entire Deposit 
Insurance Fund which then contained about $45 billion.  Exhausting the Deposit Insurance Fund

could have triggered additional panic and loss of confidence in the U.S. banking system and 
financial markets.     

231 

(2)  Other Regulatory Failures  
 
Washington Mutual was not the only failed thrift overseen by OTS.  In 2008, OTS closed 

the doors of five thrifts with combined assets of $354 billion.878  Another seven thrifts holding 
collective assets of $350 billion were sold or declared bankruptcy.879  Virtually all of these thrifts 
conducted high risk lending, accumulated portfolios with high risk assets, and sold high risk, 
poor quality mortgages to other financial institutions and investors.  At the Subcommittee 
hearing, the Treasury Inspector General testified that, after completing 17 reviews and working 
on another 33 reviews of a variety of failed financial institutions, he could say that OTS’ lack of 
enforcement action was “not unique to WaMu” and lax enforcement by the relevant federal 
banking regulator was “not unique to OTS.”880

 

 
Mortgage lenders other than banks also failed.  Many of these mortgage lenders had 

operated as private firms, rather than as depository institutions, and were not overseen by any 
federal or state bank regulator.  Some were overseen by the SEC; others were not overseen by 
any federal financial regulator.  Some became large companies handling billions of dollars in 
residential loans annually, yet operated under minimal and ineffective regulatory oversight.  
When residential loans began to default in late 2006, and the subprime securitization market 
dried up in 2007, these firms were unable to sell their loans, developed liquidity problems, and 
went out of business.  Together, these failed mortgage lenders, like the failed thrifts, contributed 
to systemic risk that damaged the U.S. banking system, U.S. financial markets, and the U.S. 
economy as a whole. 

 
(a)  Countrywide 

Countrywide Financial Corporation, now a division of Bank of America and known as 

Bank of America Home Loans, was formerly the largest independent mortgage lender in the 
United States and one of the most prolific issuers of subprime mortgages.881  For a number of 
years, Countrywide operated as a national bank under the OCC.  In March 2007, it converted to a 
thrift charter and operated for its last 18 months under the regulatory supervision of OTS.882
  At 
its height, Countrywide had approximately $200 billion in assets, 62,000 employees, and issued 
in excess of $400 billion in residential mortgages each year.  In 2008, Countrywide originated

nearly 20% of all mortgages in the United States.883  But in August 2008, after the collapse of the 
subprime secondary market, Countrywide could no longer sell or securitize its subprime loans 
and was unable to obtain replacement financing, forcing the bank into a liquidity crisis.884  By 
the end of the summer of 2008, it would have declared bankruptcy, but for its sale to Bank of 
America for $2.8 billion.885

   

Neither the OCC nor OTS ever filed a public enforcement action against the bank.  In 
June 2009, the SEC filed suit against the three most senior Countrywide executives, the chief 
executive officer, the chief operating officer and president, and the chief financial officer, 
charging them with fraudulently misleading investors by representing that Countrywide had 
issued loans primarily to “prime” or low risk borrowers, when it had actually written 
increasingly risky loans that senior executives knew would result in substantial defaults and 
delinquencies.

The SEC complaint detailed the bank’s increasingly risky underwriting and lending 
practices from 2005 to 2007, including its use of stated income loans, loan-to-value ratios in 
excess of 95%, loans to borrowers with low FICO scores, frequent use of loan exceptions, and 
willingness to match the loan terms of any competitor.  Like WaMu, from 2003 to 2007, the 
bank switched from issuing primarily low risk, 30-year loans, to subprime and other high risk 
mortgages.

The complaint also described how Mr. Mozilo was internally alarmed and critical of the 

increased credit risks that Countrywide was incurring, while at the same time telling investors

that the bank was more prudent than its competitors.
an April 2006 email from Mr. Mozilo discussing Countrywide’s issuance of subprime 80/20 
loans, which are loans that have no down payment and are comprised of a first loan for 80% of 
the home’s value and a second loan for the remaining 20% of the value, resulting in a loan-to-
value ratio of 100%.  Mr. Mozilo wrote: “In all my years in the business I have never seen a 
more toxic pr[o]duct.”890  In another email that same month, after being informed that most 
borrowers were making the minimum payments allowed on Option ARM loans, Mr. Mozilo 
wrote:  “Since over 70% have opted to make the lower payment it appears it is just a matter of 
time that we will be faced with much higher resets and therefore much higher delinquencies.”891

(b)  IndyMac 

IndyMac Bank was established in 1985 by Countrywide co-founders Angelo Mozilo and 
David Loeb.  While its lines of business changed over time, in 2000, it became a chartered thrift 
overseen by OTS, and grew to become the country’s ninth-largest originator of residential 
mortgage loans.898

packaged them into securities and sold them on the secondary market.899

   

234 

In July 2007, after the credit rating agencies downgraded the ratings on most subprime 

mortgage backed securities and the subprime secondary market collapsed, IndyMac – like 
WaMu – was left holding a large inventory of poor quality mortgage loans it could not sell.  As 
delinquencies increased and the value of the mortgages fell, IndyMac incurred substantial losses, 
and its depositors began withdrawing funds.  The withdrawals continued throughout 2007 and 
900   In 
into 2008, eventually reaching $1.55 billion and triggering a liquidity crisis at the bank.
July 2008, IndyMac collapsed and was seized by the FDIC, which had to pay more than $10 
billion from the Deposit Insurance Fund to protect insured deposits and pay related expenses.901

     

As it did with WaMu, OTS gave IndyMac high CAMELS ratings until shortly before the 

thrift’s failure, despite the fact that OTS had identified numerous problems with IndyMac’s

subprime mortgage business practices.

but did not take sufficient enforcement action to correct them.908

Then Acting OTS Director Scott Polakoff was also placed on leave during the backdating investigation, but he

New Century Financial Corporation is an example of a failed mortgage lender that 

operated largely without federal or state oversight, other than as a publicly traded corporation 
overseen by the SEC.  New Century originated, purchased, sold, and serviced billions of dollars 
in subprime residential mortgages, operating not as a bank or thrift, but first as a private 
corporation, then as a publicly traded corporation, and finally, beginning in 2004, as a publicly 
traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).916
  By 2007, New Century had approximately 7,200

standards to maximize loan production,922 and “routinely and increasingly lent money to people 
who were unable to repay the debt shortly after the loans were closed.”923  The suit took note of a

Century had represented itself as a prudent subprime lender, it “soon became evident that its 
lending practices, far from being ‘responsible,’ were the recipe for financial disaster.”926  The 
complaint detailed a number of high risk lending practices, including the issuance of interest

(d)  Fremont 

Fremont Investment & Loan was once the fifth largest subprime mortgage lender in the 
United States.931  At its peak in 2006, it had $13 billion in assets, 3,500 employees, and nearly 
two dozen offices.932  Fremont Investment & Loan was neither a bank nor a thrift, but an 
“industrial loan company” that issued loans and held insured deposits.933  It was owned by 
Fremont General Credit Corporation which was owned, in turn, by Fremont General 
Corporation.  In 2007, the bank was the subject of an FDIC cease and desist order which 
identified multiple problems with its operations and ordered the bank to cease its subprime 
lending.934  In 2008, due to insufficient capital, the FDIC ordered Fremont General Corporation 
to either recapitalize the bank or sell it.  The bank was then sold to CapitalSource, Inc.935

As a California based industrial loan company, Fremont Investment & Loan was 

overseen by the California Department of Financial Institutions, a state bank regulator.  Since it 
937  The March 
had deposits that were federally insured, Fremont was also regulated by the FDIC.
2007 FDIC cease and desist order required the bank to end its subprime lending business, due to 
“unsafe and unsound banking practices and violations of law,” including operating with “a large 
volume of poor quality loans”; “unsatisfactory lending practices”; “excessive risk”; and 
inadequate capital.938  The FDIC also determined that the bank lacked effective risk management 
practices, lacked adequate mortgage underwriting criteria, and was “approving loans with loan-
to-value ratios approaching or exceeding 100 percent of the value of the collateral.”939

   

Many of the specific practices cited in the cease and desist order mirror the FDIC and 

OTS criticisms of WaMu.  For example, the FDIC determined that Fremont was “marketing and 
extending adjustable-rate mortgage (‘ARM’) products to subprime borrowers in an unsafe and 
unsound manner that greatly increase[d] the risk that borrowers will default”; “qualifying 
borrowers for loans with low initial payments based on an introductory or ‘start’ rate that will 
expire after an initial period”; “approving borrowers without considering appropriate 
documentation and/or verification of the their income”; and issuing loans with “features likely to 
require frequent refinancing to maintain an affordable monthly payment and/or to avoid 
foreclosure.”
mortgages it had sold to investors.941

940  Fremont later reported receiving default notices on $3.15 billion in subprime 

 

One year later, in March 2008, the FDIC filed another public enforcement action against 

the bank, for failing to provide an acceptable capital restoration plan or obtaining sufficient 
capital, and ordered the bank’s parent company to either adequately capitalize the bank within 60 
days or sell it.

  The bank was then sold to CapitalSource, Inc.   

942

The FDIC took action against Fremont much earlier – in March 2007 – than other 

regulators did with respect to other financial institutions, including OTS’ nonpublic enforcement 
actions against WaMu in March and September 2008; the FDIC’s seizure of IndyMac in July 
2008; the SEC’s action against Countrywide in June 2009; and the SEC’s action against New

Century in December 2009.  By putting an early end to Fremont’s subprime lending, the FDIC 
stopped it from selling additional poor quality mortgage backed securities into U.S. securitization 
markets. 

In November 2008, the OCC researched the ten metropolitan areas with the highest 

foreclosure rates and identified the ten lenders in each area with the most foreclosed loans; Long 
Beach, Countrywide, IndyMac, New Century, and Fremont all made the list of the “Worst Ten in 
the Worst Ten.”943  Moody’s, the credit rating agency, later calculated that, in 2006 alone, Long 
Beach, New Century, and Fremont were responsible for 24% of the residential subprime 
mortgage backed securities issued, but 50% of the subsequent credit rating downgrades of those 
securities.944
quality home loans.  By allowing these lenders, for years, to sell and securitize billions of dollars 
in poor quality, high risk home loans, regulators permitted them to contaminate the secondary 
market and introduce systemic risk throughout the U.S. financial system.   

  The fact is that each of these lenders issued billions of dollars in high risk, poor 

  E.  Preventing Regulatory Failures 

Regulators stood on the sidelines as U.S. mortgage lenders introduced increasingly high 
risk mortgage products into the U.S. mortgage market.  Stated income loans, NINA loans, and 
so-called “liar loans” were issued without verifying the borrower’s income or assets.  Alt A loans 
also had reduced documentation requirements.  Interest-only loans, Option ARMs, and hybrid 
ARMs involved charging low introductory interest rates on loans that could be refinanced before 
much higher interest rates took effect.  Negative amortization loans – loans that became bigger 
rather than smaller over time – became commonplace.  Home equity loans and lines of credit, 
piggybacks and silent seconds, 100% financing – all involved loans that required the borrower to 
make virtually no down payment or equity investment in the property, relying instead on the 
value of the property to ensure repayment of the loan.  All of these loans involved higher risks 
than the 30-year and 15-year fixed rate mortgages that dominated the U.S. mortgage market prior 
to 2004.  When property values stopped climbing in late 2006, these higher risk loans began 
incurring delinquencies, losses, and defaults at record rates.    

A number of new developments have occurred in the past several years to address the 

problems highlighted throughout this Report.   

(1)  New Developments 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), 

which the President signed into law on July 21, 2010, contains many changes in the law that will 
be implemented over the next year.  The Dodd-Frank changes include abolishing OTS, banning 
stated income loans, and restricting negative amortization loans.  Other developments include a 
revised interagency agreement strengthening the FDIC’s ability to conduct examinations of

insured depository institutions and a new FDIC deposit insurance pricing system that requires 
higher risk institutions to pay higher insurance fees. 

OTS Abolished.  One significant new change brought about by the Dodd-Frank Act is 
the abolishment of the Office of Thrift Supervision.  Title III of the Dodd-Frank Act reassigned 
OTS’ duties and personnel to other agencies, primarily the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (OCC).945
partner with the OCC, the statute is clear in its intent to abolish OTS, rather than effect a merger 
of equals.   

  Although some OTS officials claim the law intended OTS to be a merger 

Revised Interagency Agreement.  A second important change is that the interagency 

946

agreement that guides when the FDIC can examine an insured institution was altered to give the 
FDIC increased authority.  Under federal law, the FDIC can conduct an examination of an 
insured depository institution “whenever the [FDIC] Board of Directors determines a special 
examination … is necessary to determine the condition of such depository institution for 
insurance purposes.”
  Despite this broad statutory grant of examination authority, in 2002, the 
FDIC agreed to limit the circumstances in which it would examine banks subject to regulation by 
another agency.  The resulting interagency agreement essentially required the FDIC to establish 
that an institution was at “heightened risk” of causing loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund before 
the FDIC could compel another banking regulator to allow the FDIC to participate in an 
examination of its operations.  OTS used that agreement to impede the FDIC’s participation in 
examinations of WaMu.   

947

  Compared to the 2002 version, the revised agreement explicitly provides 

In 2010, the FDIC renegotiated that agreement with the other financial regulators, and 
they signed a revised version that will facilitate more cooperation on a less bureaucratic and 
more timely basis.
for special examinations of a broader scope of insured depository institutions.  It also streamlined 
the process for resolving differences in CAMELS ratings between financial regulators.  In the 
case of WaMu, this new process would have helped facilitate a quicker response to WaMu’s 
deteriorating condition.  Additionally, the new agreement establishes a continuous on-site FDIC 
presence, with five or more examiners, at certain large institutions, including those that receive 
ratings under the FDIC’s Large Insured Depository Institutions Program.  This new provision 
ensures the FDIC has consistent access to information about big banks that, by virtue of their 
size, pose the most risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund.  Finally, after first discussing it with the 
primary federal regulator, the FDIC is permitted to gather information directly from financial 
institutions.  These provisions will help ensure that the FDIC can obtain the information needed 
to safeguard the Deposit Insurance Fund.

small part to the work of your Subcommittee in identifying weaknesses in the supervisory processes leading up to 
the failure of Washington Mutual.”). 

241 

Risk Factors in Insurance Fees.  Under a new FDIC deposit insurance pricing system 
that takes effect in 2011, large depository institutions with higher risk activities will be required 
to pay higher fees into the Deposit Insurance Fund.948  This new assessment system is designed 
to “better capture risk at the time large institutions assume the risk, to better differentiate among 
institutions for risk and take a more forward-looking view of risk, [and] to better take into 
account the losses that the FDIC may incur if such an insured depository institution fails.”949  It 
is the product of both past FDIC revisions and changes to the insurance fund assessment system 
made by the Dodd-Frank Act.950  It is intended to impose higher assessments on large banks 
“with high-risk asset concentrations, less stable balance sheet liquidity, or potentially higher loss 
severity in the event of failure,” and impose those higher assessments when the banks “assume 
these risks rather than when conditions deteriorate.”951
higher risk activities will be assessed higher fees, not only to safeguard the insurance fund and 
allocate insurance costs more fairly, but also to help discourage high risk activities. 

  Under this new system, banks with 

Financial Stability Oversight Council.  The Dodd-Frank Act has also established a new 

 
intra-governmental council, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), to identify 
systemic risks and respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system.
The council is comprised of ten existing regulators in the financial services sector, including the 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Chairman of the FDIC, and the 
Comptroller of the Currency, and is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury.  This Council is 
intended to ensure that U.S. financial regulators consider the safety and soundness of not only 
individual financial institutions, but also of U.S. financial markets and systems as a whole. 

952

  

  

(2)   Recommendations 
To further strengthen oversight of financial institutions to reduce risk, protect U.S. 
financial markets and the economy, and safeguard the Deposit Insurance Fund, this Report 
makes the following recommendations. 

1.  Complete OTS Dismantling.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) 

should complete the dismantling of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), despite 
attempts by some OTS officials to preserve the agency’s identity and influence within 
the OCC. 

2.  Strengthen Enforcement.  Federal banking regulators should conduct a review of 

their major financial institutions to identify those with ongoing, serious deficiencies, 
and review their enforcement approach to those institutions to eliminate any policy of 
deference to bank management, inflated CAMELS ratings, or use of short term profits 
to excuse high risk activities.

952 See Title I, Subtitle A, of the Dodd-Frank Act establishing the Financial Stability Oversight Council, including 
Section 112(a) which provides its purposes and duties. 

242 

3.  Strengthen CAMELS Ratings.  Federal banking regulators should undertake a 

comprehensive review of the CAMELS ratings system to produce ratings that signal 
whether an institution is expected to operate in a safe and sound manner over a 
specified period of time, asset quality ratings that reflect embedded risks rather than 
short term profits, management ratings that reflect any ongoing failure to correct 
identified deficiencies, and composite ratings that discourage systemic risks. 

4.  Evaluate Impacts of High Risk Lending.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council 

should undertake a study to identify high risk lending practices at financial 
institutions, and evaluate the nature and significance of the impacts that these 
practices may have on U.S. financial systems as a whole.

V.  INFLATED CREDIT RATINGS: 
  CASE STUDY OF MOODY’S AND STANDARD & POOR’S 
 

 

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services 

LLC (S&P), the two largest credit rating agencies (CRAs) in the United States, issued the AAA 
ratings that made residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) and collateralized debt 
obligations (CDOs) seem like safe investments, helped build an active market for those 
securities, and then, beginning in July 2007, downgraded the vast majority of those AAA ratings 
to junk status.953
plummeting, precipitated the collapse of the RMBS and CDO secondary markets, and perhaps 
more than any other single event triggered the financial crisis.   

  The July mass downgrades sent the value of mortgage related securities 

 
In the months and years of buildup to the financial crisis, warnings about the massive 

problems in the mortgage industry were not adequately addressed within the ratings industry.  By 
the time the rating agencies admitted their AAA ratings were inaccurate, it took the form of a 
massive ratings correction that was unprecedented in U.S. financial markets.  The result was an 
economic earthquake from which the aftershocks continue today. 

 
Between 2004 and 2007, taking in increasing revenue from Wall Street firms, Moody’s 

and S&P issued investment grade credit ratings for the vast majority of the RMBS and CDO 
securities issued in the United States, deeming them safe investments even though many relied 
on subprime and other high risk home loans.  In late 2006, high risk mortgages began to go 
delinquent at an alarming rate.  Despite signs of a deteriorating mortgage market, Moody’s and 
S&P continued for six months to issue investment grade ratings for numerous subprime RMBS 
and CDO securities.  In July 2007, as mortgage defaults intensified and subprime RMBS and 
CDO securities began incurring losses, both companies abruptly reversed course and began 
downgrading at record numbers hundreds and then thousands of their RMBS and CDO ratings, 
some less than a year old.  Investors like banks, pension funds, and insurance companies were 
suddenly forced to sell off their RMBS and CDO holdings, because they had lost their 
investment grade status.  RMBS and CDO securities held by financial firms lost much of their 
value, and new securitizations were unable to find investors.  The subprime RMBS market 
initially froze and then collapsed, leaving investors and financial firms around the world holding 
unmarketable subprime RMBS securities plummeting in value.  A few months later, the CDO 
market collapsed as well.  

Traditionally, investments holding AAA ratings have had a less than 1% probability of 
incurring defaults.  But in the financial crisis, the vast majority of RMBS and CDO securities 
with AAA ratings incurred substantial losses; some failed outright.  Investors and financial 
institutions holding those AAA securities lost significant value.  Those widespread losses led, in 
turn, to a loss of investor confidence in the value of the AAA rating, in the holdings of major 
U.S. financial institutions, and even in the viability of U.S. financial markets.  Inaccurate AAA 

                                                 
953 S&P issues ratings using the “AAA” designation; Moody’s equivalent rating is “Aaa.”  For ease of reference, this 
Report will refer to both ratings as “AAA.” 

244 

 

credit ratings introduced systemic risk into the U.S. financial system and constituted a key cause 
of the financial crisis. 

 
The Subcommittee’s investigation uncovered a host of factors responsible for the 

inaccurate credit ratings issued by Moody’s and S&P.  One significant cause was the inherent 
conflict of interest arising from the system used to pay for credit ratings.  Credit rating agencies 
were paid by the Wall Street firms that sought their ratings and profited from the financial 
products being rated.  The rating companies were dependent upon those Wall Street firms to 
bring them business and were vulnerable to threats that the firms would take their business 
elsewhere if they did not get the ratings they wanted.  Rating standards weakened as each credit 
rating agency competed to provide the most favorable rating to win business and greater market 
share.  The result was a race to the bottom.   

 
Additional factors responsible for the inaccurate ratings include rating models that failed 
to include relevant mortgage performance data, unclear and subjective criteria used to produce 
ratings, a failure to apply updated rating models to existing rated transactions, and a failure to 
provide adequate staffing to perform rating and surveillance services, despite record revenues.  
Compounding these problems were federal regulations that required the purchase of investment 
grade securities by banks and others, thereby creating pressure on the credit rating agencies to 
issue investment grade ratings.  Still another factor were the Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s (SEC) regulations which required use of credit ratings by Nationally Recognized 
Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSRO) for various purposes but, until recently, resulted in 
only three NRSROs, thereby limiting competition.954

  

 
Evidence gathered by the Subcommittee shows that credit rating agencies were aware of 
problems in the mortgage market, including an unsustainable rise in housing prices, the high risk 
nature of the loans being issued, lax lending standards, and rampant mortgage fraud.  Instead of 
using this information to temper their ratings, the firms continued to issue a high volume of 
investment grade ratings for mortgage backed securities.  If the credit rating agencies had issued 
ratings that accurately exposed the increasing risk in the RMBS and CDO markets and 
appropriately adjusted existing ratings in those markets, they might have discouraged investors 
from purchasing high risk RMBS and CDO securities, slowed the pace of securitizations, and as 
a result reduced their own profits.  It was not in the short term economic self interest of either 
Moody’s or S&P to provide accurate credit ratings for high risk RMBS and CDO securities, 
because doing so would have hurt their own revenues.  Instead, the credit rating agencies’ profits 
became increasingly reliant on the fees generated by issuing a large volume of investment grade 
ratings.

essentially one of ‘we know-it-when-we-see-it.’  The resulting limited growth in the pool of NRSROs was widely

Looking back after the first shock of the crisis, one Moody’s managing director offered 

this critical self analysis: 

 
“[W]hy didn’t we envision that credit would tighten after being loose, and housing prices 
would fall after rising, after all most economic events are cyclical and bubbles inevitably 
burst.  Combined, these errors make us look either incompetent at credit analysis, or like 
we sold our soul to the devil for revenue, or a little bit of both.”955

 

 

A.  Subcommittee Investigation and Findings of Fact 
For more than one year, the Subcommittee conducted an in-depth investigation of the role 

of credit rating agencies in the financial crisis, using as case histories Moody’s and S&P.  The 
Subcommittee subpoenaed and reviewed hundreds of thousands of documents from both 
companies including reports, analyses, memoranda, correspondence, and email, as well as 
documents from a number of financial institutions that obtained ratings for RMBS and CDO 
securities.  The Subcommittee also collected and reviewed documents from the SEC and reports 
produced by academics and government agencies on credit rating issues.  In addition, the 
Subcommittee conducted nearly two dozen interviews with current and former Moody’s and 
S&P executives, managers, and analysts, and consulted with credit rating experts from the SEC, 
Federal Reserve, academia, and industry.  On April 23, 2010, the Subcommittee held a hearing 
and released 100 hearing exhibits.956

 
In connection with the hearing, the Subcommittee released a joint memorandum from 
Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Coburn summarizing the investigation into the credit 
rating agencies and the problems with the credit ratings assigned to RMBS and CDO securities.  
The memorandum contained joint findings regarding the role of the credit rating agencies in the 
Moody’s and S&P case histories, which this Report reaffirms.  The findings of fact are as 
follows. 

 

1.  Inaccurate Rating Models.  From 2004 to 2007, Moody’s and S&P used credit 
rating models with data that was inadequate to predict how high risk residential 
mortgages, such as subprime, interest only, and option adjustable rate mortgages, 
would perform. 

2.  Competitive Pressures.  Competitive pressures, including the drive for market share 
and need to accommodate investment bankers bringing in business, affected the credit 
ratings issued by Moody’s and S&P. 

3.  Failure to Re-evaluate.  By 2006, Moody’s and S&P knew their ratings of RMBS 

and CDOs were inaccurate, revised their rating models to produce more accurate 
ratings, but then failed to use the revised model to re-evaluate existing RMBS and

Subcommittee on Investigations, S.Hrg. 11-673 (4/23/2010) (hereinafter “April 23, 2010 Subcommittee Hearing”). 

CDO securities, delaying thousands of rating downgrades and allowing those 
securities to carry inflated ratings that could mislead investors. 

246 

 

4.  Failure to Factor in Fraud, Laxity, or Housing Bubble.  From 2004 to 2007, 

Moody’s and S&P knew of increased credit risks due to mortgage fraud, lax 
underwriting standards, and unsustainable housing price appreciation, but failed 
adequately to incorporate those factors into their credit rating models. 

5.  Inadequate Resources.  Despite record profits from 2004 to 2007, Moody’s and 

S&P failed to assign sufficient resources to adequately rate new products and test the 
accuracy of existing ratings. 

6.  Mass Downgrades Shocked Market.  Mass downgrades by Moody’s and S&P, 

including downgrades of hundreds of subprime RMBS over a few days in July 2007, 
downgrades by Moody’s of CDOs in October 2007, and actions taken (including 
downgrading and placing securities on credit watch with negative implications) by 
S&P on over 6,300 RMBS and 1,900 CDOs on one day in January 2008, shocked the 
financial markets, helped cause the collapse of the subprime secondary market, 
triggered sales of assets that had lost investment grade status, and damaged holdings 
of financial firms worldwide, contributing to the financial crisis. 

7.  Failed Ratings.  Moody’s and S&P each rated more than 10,000 RMBS securities 
from 2006 to 2007, downgraded a substantial number within a year, and, by 2010, 
had downgraded many AAA ratings to junk status. 

8.  Statutory Bar.  The SEC is barred by statute from conducting needed oversight into 

the substance, procedures, and methodologies of the credit rating models. 

9.  Legal Pressure for AAA Ratings.  Legal requirements that some regulated entities, 
such as banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies, pension funds, and others, hold 
assets with AAA or investment grade credit ratings, created pressure on credit rating 
agencies to issue inflated ratings making assets eligible for purchase by those entities. 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

   

(1) Credit Ratings Generally 
Credit ratings, which first gained prominence in the late 1800s, are supposed to provide 

The United States has three major credit rating agencies:  Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch 

 
independent assessments of the creditworthiness of particular financial instruments, such as a 
corporate bond, mortgage backed security, or CDO.  Essentially, credit ratings predict the 
likelihood that a debt will be repaid.957

total credit ratings and collect 90% of total credit rating revenue.
 
 
charging subscription fees to investors who were considering investing in the financial 
instruments being rated.  This method of payment was known as the “subscriber-pays” model.  
Following the 1929 crash, the credit rating agencies fell out of favor.  As one academic expert 
has explained: 
 

Paying for Ratings.  Prior to the 1929 crash, credit rating agencies made money by 

958

   

“Investors were no longer very interested in purchasing ratings, particularly given the 
agencies’ poor track record in anticipating the sharp drop in bond values beginning in late 
1929.  … The rating business remained stagnant for decades.”959

Credit Ratings.  Credit ratings use a scale of letter grades, from AAA to C, with AAA 

In 1970, the credit rating agencies changed to an “issuer-pays” model and have used it since.960
  
In this model, the party seeking to issue a financial instrument, such as a bond or security, pays 
the credit rating agency to analyze the credit risk and assign a credit rating to the financial 
instrument. 
 
 
ratings designating the safest investments and the other grades designating investments at greater 
risk of default.961  Investments with AAA ratings have historically had low default rates.  For 
example, S&P reported that its cumulative RMBS default rate by original rating class (through 
September 15, 2007) was 0.04% for AAA initial ratings and 1.09% for BBB.962

instruments bearing AAA through BBB- ratings are generally called “investment grade,” while 
those with ratings below BBB- (or Baa3) are referred to as “below investment grade” or 
sometimes as “junk” investments.  Financial instruments that default receive a D rating from 
S&P, but no rating at all by Moody’s. 
 
 
former senior credit analyst at Moody’s explained that investors use ratings to: 
 

Investors often rely on credit ratings to gauge the safety of a particular investment.  A 

“satisfy any number of possible needs:  institutional investors such as insurance 
companies and pension funds may have portfolio guidelines or requirements, investment 
fund portfolio managers may have risk-based capital requirements or investment 
committee requirements.  And of course, private investors lacking the resources to do 
separate analysis may use the published ratings as their principal determinant of the risk 
of the investment.”963

   

  The rationale behind these legal requirements is to require or 

 
Legal Requirements.  Some state and federal laws restrict the amount of below 
 
investment grade bonds that certain investors can hold, such as pension funds, insurance 
companies, and banks.  Banks, for example, are limited by law in the amount of non-investment 
grade bonds they can hold, and are sometimes required to post additional capital for those higher 
risk instruments.964  Broker-dealers and money market funds that register with the SEC operate 
under similar restrictions.965
provide economic incentives for banks and other financial institutions to purchase investments 
that have been identified as liquid and “safe” by an independent third party with a high level of 
market expertise, such as a credit rating agency.  Because so many federal and state statutes and 
regulations require the purchase of investment grade ratings, issuers of securities and other 
instruments work hard to obtain favorable credit ratings to ensure regulated financial institutions 
can buy their products.  As a result, those legal requirements not only increased the demand for 
investment grade ratings, but also created pressure on credit rating agencies to issue top ratings 
in order to make the rated products eligible for purchase by regulated financial institutions.  The 
legal requirements also generated more work and greater profits for the credit rating agencies.

CRA Oversight and Accountability.  The credit rating agencies are currently subject to 
regulation by the SEC.  In September 2006, Congress enacted the Credit Rating Agency Reform 
Act, P.L. 109-291, to require SEC oversight of the credit rating industry.  Among other 
provisions, the law charged the SEC with designating NRSROs and defined that term for the first 
time.  By 2008, the SEC had granted NRSRO status to ten credit rating agencies (CRA).966  The 
Act also directed the SEC to conduct examinations of the CRAs, while at the same time 
prohibiting the SEC from regulating the substance, criteria, or methodologies used in credit 
rating models.967

 

 
Prior to the 2006 Reform Act, CRAs had been subject to uneven or limited regulatory 

oversight by state and federal agencies.  The SEC had developed the NRSRO system, for 
example, but had no clear statutory basis for establishing that system or exercising regulatory 
authority over the credit rating agencies.  Because the requirements for the NRSRO designation 
were not defined in law, the SEC had designated only three rating agencies, limiting competition.  
No government agency conducted routine examinations of the credit rating agencies or the 
procedures they used to rate financial products. 

 
In addition, private investors have generally been unable to hold CRAs accountable for 

poor quality ratings or other malfeasance through civil lawsuits.968  The CRAs have successfully 
won dismissal of investor lawsuits, claiming that they are in the financial publishing business 
and their opinions are protected under the First Amendment.969
  In addition, the CRAs have 
attempted to avoid any legal liability for their ratings by making disclaimers to investors who 
potentially may rely on their opinions.  For example, S&P’s disclaimer reads in part as follows:  

 
“Standard & Poor’s Ratings  
Analytic services provided by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (‘Ratings Services’) 
are the result of separate activities designed to preserve the independence and objectivity 
of ratings opinions.  The credit ratings and observations contained herein are solely

RMBS and CDO Ratings.  Over the last ten years, Wall Street firms have devised ever 

more complex financial instruments for sale to investors, including the RMBS and CDO 
securities that played a key role in the financial crisis.  Because of the complexity of the 
instruments, investors often relied heavily on credit ratings to determine whether they could or 
should buy the products.  For a fee, Wall Street firms helped design the RMBS and CDO 
securities, worked with the credit rating agencies to obtain ratings, and sold the securities to 
investors like pension funds, insurance companies, university endowments, municipalities, and 
hedge funds.971
more difficult time selling these products to investors, because each investor would have had to 
perform its own due diligence review of the financial instrument.  Credit ratings simplified the 
review and enhanced sales.  Here’s how one federal bank regulatory handbook put it: 

  Without investment grade ratings, Wall Street firms would have had a much 

“The rating agencies perform a critical role in structured finance – evaluating the credit 
quality of the transactions.  Such agencies are considered credible because they possess 
the expertise to evaluate various underlying asset types, and because they do not have a 
financial interest in a security’s cost or yield.  Ratings are important because investors 
generally accept ratings by the major public rating agencies in lieu of conducting a due 
diligence investigation of the underlying assets and the servicer.”

972

  

 

In addition to making structured finance products easier to sell to investors, Wall Street 
firms used financial engineering to create high risk assets that were given AAA ratings – ratings 
which are normally reserved for ultra-safe investments with low rates of return.  Firms combined 
high risk assets, such as the BBB tranches from subprime mortgage backed securities paying a 
relatively high rate of return, in a new financial instrument, such as a CDO, that issued securities 
with AAA ratings and were purportedly safe investments.  Higher rates of return, combined with 
AAA ratings, made subprime RMBS and related CDO securities especially attractive 
investments. 

 
(2) The Rating Process   
 
Prior to the massive ratings downgrade in mid-2007, the RMBS and CDO rating process 
followed a generally well-defined pattern.  It began with the firm designing the securitization –  
the arranger – sending a detailed proposal to the credit rating agency.  The proposal contained 
information on the mortgage pools involved and how the security would be structured.  The 
rating agency examined the proposal and provided comments and suggestions, before ultimately 
agreeing to run the securitization through one of its models.  The results from the model were 
used by a rating committee within the agency to determine a final rating, which was then 
published.

Securitization,” at 11. 

    

  To create that hierarchy, the arranger placed the pool’s 

Arrangers.  For RMBS, the “arranger” – typically an investment bank – initiated the 

251 

 

In addition to data on the assets, the arranger provided a proposed capital structure for the 

 
rating process by sending to the credit rating agency information about a prospective RMBS and 
data about the mortgage loans included in the prospective pool.  The data typically identified the 
characteristics of each mortgage in the pool including:  the principal amount, geographic location 
of the property, FICO score, loan to value ratio of the property, and type of loan.  In the case of a 
CDO, the process also included a review of the underlying assets, but was based primarily on the 
ratings those assets had already received.   
 
financial instrument, identifying, for example, how many tranches would be created, how the 
revenues being paid into the RMBS or CDO would be divided up among those tranches, and 
how many of the tranches were designed to receive investment grade ratings.  The arranger also 
identified one or more “credit enhancements” for the pool to create a financial cushion that 
would protect the designated investment grade tranches from expected losses.973
 
Credit Enhancements.  Arrangers used a variety of credit enhancements.  The most 
 
common was “subordination” in which the arranger “creates a hierarchy of loss absorption 
among the tranche securities.”974
tranches in an order, with the lowest tranche required to absorb any losses first, before the next 
highest tranche.  Losses might occur, for example, if borrowers defaulted on their mortgages and 
stopped making mortgage payments into the pool.  Lower level tranches most at risk of having to 
absorb losses typically received noninvestment grade ratings from the credit rating agencies, 
while the higher level tranches that were protected from loss typically received investment grade 
ratings.  One key task for both the arrangers and the credit rating agencies was to calculate the 
amount of “subordination” required to ensure that the higher tranches in a pool were protected 
from loss and could be given AAA or other investment grade ratings.  
 
 
credit enhancement, the arranger ensured that the revenues expected to be produced by the assets 
in a pool exceeded the revenues designated to be paid out to each of the tranches.  That excess 
amount provided a financial cushion for the pool and was used to create an “equity” tranche, 
which was the first tranche in the pool to absorb losses if the expected payments into the pool 
were reduced.  This equity tranche was subordinate to all the other tranches in the pool and did 
not receive any credit rating.  The larger the excess, the larger the equity tranche, and the larger 
the cushion created to absorb losses and protect the more senior tranches in the pool.  In some 
pools, the equity tranche was also designed to pay a relatively higher rate of return to the party or 
parties who held that tranche due to its higher risk.   
 
 
which involved designating an amount of revenue to pay the pool’s monthly expenses and other 
liabilities, but ensuring that the amount was slightly more than what was likely needed for that 

Still another common form of credit enhancement was the creation of “excess spread,” 

A second common form of credit enhancement was “over-collateralization.”  In this

The major RMBS credit rating model at Moody’s was called the Mortgage Metrics 

Credit Rating Models.  After the arranger submitted the pool information, proposed 

To derive the default or loss rate for an RMBS pool of residential mortgages, the CRA 

purpose.  Any funds not actually spent on expenses would provide an additional financial 
cushion to absorb losses, if necessary.  
 
 
capital structure, and proposed credit enhancements to the CRA, a CRA analyst was assigned to 
evaluate the proposed financial instrument.  The first step that most CRA analysts took was to 
use a credit rating model to evaluate the rate of probable defaults or expected losses from the 
asset pool.  Credit rating models are mathematical constructs that analyze a large number of data 
points related to the likelihood of an asset defaulting.  RMBS rating models typically use 
statistical analyses of past mortgage performance data to calculate expected RMBS default rates 
and losses.  In contrast, rather than statistics, CDO models use assumptions to build simulations 
that can be used to project likely CDO defaults and losses.   
 
 
Model (M3), while the S&P model was called the Loan Evaluation and Estimate of Loss System 
(LEVELS).  Both models used large amounts of statistical data related to the performance of 
residential mortgages over time to develop criteria to analyze and rate submitted mortgage pools.  
CRA analysts relied on these quantitative models to predict expected loss (Moody’s) or the 
probability of default (S&P) for a pool of residential loans.   
 
 
analyst typically fed a “loan tape” – most commonly a spreadsheet provided by the arranger with 
details on each loan – into the credit rating model.  The rating model then automatically assessed 
the expected credit performance of each loan in the pool and aggregated that information.  To 
perform this function, the model selected certain data points from the loan tape, such as borrower 
credit scores or loan-to-value ratios, and compared that information to past mortgage data using 
various assumptions, to determine the likely “frequency of foreclosure” and “loss severity” for 
the particular types of mortgages under consideration.  It then projected the level of “credit 
enhancement,” or cushion needed to protect investment grade tranches from loss.   
 
 
from losses.  For example, the model might project that 30% of the pool’s incoming revenue 
would need to be set aside to ensure that the remaining 70% of incoming revenues would be 
protected from any losses.  Tranches representing the 70% of the incoming revenues could then 
receive AAA ratings, while the remaining 30% of incoming revenues could be assigned to 
support the payment of expenses, an equity tranche, or one or more of the subordinated tranches. 
 
 
qualitative factors in their analysis of expected default and loss rates.  For example, Moody’s 
analysts considered the quality of the originators and servicers of the loans included in a pool.  
Originators known for issuing poor quality loans or servicers known for providing poor quality 
servicing could increase the loss levels calculated for a pool by a significant degree, up to a total 

For riskier loans, the model required a larger cushion to protect investment grade tranches 

In addition to using quantitative models, Moody’s analysts also took into account

Credit Analysis.  After obtaining the model’s projections for the cushion or 

In addition to evaluating an RMBS pool’s expected default and loss rates, credit 

of 20%.975  Moody’s only began incorporating that type of analysis into its M3 ratings process in 
December 2006, only six months before the mass downgrades began.976  In contrast, S&P 
analysts did not conduct this type of analysis of mortgage originators and servicers during the 
time period examined in this Report.977
 
  
subordination needed to protect the pool’s investment grade tranches from loss, the CRA analyst 
compared that projection to the tranches and credit enhancements actually proposed for the 
particular pool to evaluate their sufficiency.    
 
 
enhancements, and capital structure, CRA analysts conducted a cash flow analysis of the interest 
and principal payments to be made into the proposed pool to determine that the revenue 
generated would be sufficient to pay the rates of return projected for each proposed tranche.  
CRA analysts also reviewed the proposed legal structure of the financial instrument to 
understand how it worked and how revenues and losses would be allocated.  Some RMBS and 
CDO transactions included complex “waterfalls” that allocated projected revenues and expected 
losses among an array of expenses, tranches, and parties.  The CRA analyst was expected to 
evaluate whether the projected revenues were sufficient for the designated purposes.  The CRA 
review also included a legal analysis “ensuring that there was no structural risk presented due to 
a failure to fulfill minimally necessary legal requirements … and confirming that the deal 
documentation accurately and faithfully described the structure modeled by the Quant 
[quantitative analyst].”978
 
 
analysts used CDO rating models to predict the CDO’s expected defaults and losses.  However, 
unlike RMBS statistical models that used past performance data to predict RMBS default and 
loss rates, the CDO models relied primarily on the underlying ratings of the assets as well as on a 
set of assumptions, such as asset correlation, and ran multiple simulations to predict how the 
CDO pool would perform.  The CDO simulation model at Moody’s was called “CDOROM,” 
while the S&P CDO model was called the “CDO Evaluator,” which was repeatedly updated, 
eventually to “Evaluator 3” or “E3.”  Both companies’ CDO models analyzed the likely rates of 
loss for assets within a particular CDO, but neither model re-analyzed any underlying RMBS 

The process for assigning credit ratings to cash CDOs followed a similar path.  CRA

RMBS rating analyses.  6/24/2010 supplemental letter from S&P to the Subcommittee, Hearing Exhibit

instrument, the CRA analyst developed a rating recommendation for each proposed RMBS or 
CDO tranche that would be used to issue securities, and presented the recommended ratings 
internally to a rating committee composed of other analysts and managers within the credit rating 
agency.  The rating committee reviewed and then voted on the analyst’s recommendations.  Once 
the committee approved the ratings, a rating committee memorandum was prepared 
memorializing the actions taken, and the ratings were provided to the arranger.  If the arranger 
indicated that the issuer accepted the ratings, the credit rating agency made the ratings available

Structured Finance Group.  The setup was similar at S&P.  At S&P, RMBS ratings were issued 
by the RMBS Group, which had about 90 analysts in 2007, while CDO ratings were issued by 

 RMBS and CDO Groups.  Moody’s and S&P had separate groups and analysts

synthetic CDOs do not contain any cash producing assets, but simply reference them.  The revenues paid into 
synthetic CDOs do not come from mortgages or other assets, but from counterparties betting that the referenced 
assets will lose value or suffer a specified credit event.

Ratings Group was Joanne Rose; the head of the RMBS Group was Frank Raiter and then Susan 
Barnes; and the head of the Global CDO Group was Richard Gugliada. 
 
Surveillance.  Following an initial credit rating, both Moody’s and S&P conducted 
 
ongoing surveillance of all rated securities to evaluate a product’s ongoing credit risk and to 
determine whether its credit rating should be affirmed, upgraded, or downgraded over the life of 
the security.  Both used automated surveillance tools that, on a monthly basis, flagged securities 
whose performance indicated their rating might need to be adjusted to reflect the current risk of 
default or loss.  Surveillance analysts investigated the flagged securities and presented 
recommendations for rating changes to a ratings committee.   
 
 
surveillance analysts and 24 derivatives surveillance analysts, respectively.983  S&P maintained a 
Structured Finance Surveillance Group that included an RMBS Surveillance Group and a CDO 
Surveillance Group, with about 20 analysts in each group in 2007.984
  Each of these groups was 
headed by a Managing Director who reported to the head of the Structured Finance Group.  The 
Managing Director for Moody’s surveillance analysts was Nicolas Weill.  At S&P, the Managing 
Director of the Structured Finance Surveillance Group was Peter D’Erchia. 
 
 
after surveillance, is to forecast a security’s probability of default (S&P) or expected loss 
(Moody’s).  If the security has an extremely low likelihood of default, credit rating agencies 
grant it AAA status.  For securities with a higher probability of default, they provide lower credit 
ratings.  
 
When asked about the meaning of an AAA rating, Moody’s CEO Raymond McDaniel 
 
explained that it represented the safest type of investment and had the same significance across 
various types of financial products.985
  While all credit rating agencies leave room for error by 
designing procedures to downgrade or upgrade ratings over time, Moody’s and S&P told the 
Subcommittee that their ratings are designed to take into account future performance.  Prior to

Revenues increased dramatically over time as well.  Moody’s gross revenues from 

(3)   Record Revenues 
From 2004 to 2007, Moody’s and S&P produced a record number of ratings and a record 
amount of revenues in structured finance, primarily because of RMBS and CDO ratings.  A 2008 
S&P submission to the SEC indicates, for example, that from 2004 to 2007, S&P issued more 
than 5,500 RMBS ratings and more than 835 mortgage related CDO ratings.987  The number of 
ratings it issued increased each year, going from approximately 700 RMBS ratings in 2002, to 
more than 1,600 in 2006.  Its mortgage related CDO ratings increased tenfold, going from 34 in 
2002, to over 340 in 2006.988  Moody’s experienced similar growth.  According to a 2008 
Moody’s submission to the SEC, from 2004 to 2007, it issued over 4,000 RMBS ratings and over 
870 CDO ratings.989  Moody’s also increased the ratings it issued each year, going from 
approximately 540 RMBS and 45 CDO ratings in 2002, to more than 1,200 RMBS and 360 CDO 
ratings in 2006.990
 
 
Both companies charged substantial fees to rate a product.  To obtain an RMBS or CDO 
rating during the height of the market, for example, S&P charged issuers generally from $40,000 
to $135,000 to rate tranches of an RMBS and from $30,000 to $750,000 to rate the tranches of a 
CDO.991  Surveillance fees, which may be imposed at the initial rating or annually, ranged 
generally from $5,000 to $50,000 for these mortgage backed securities.992
 
 
RMBS and CDO ratings more than tripled in five years, from over $61 million in 2002, to over 
$260 million in 2006.993
RMBS and mortgage related CDO ratings was over $64 million and increased to over $265

C.  Mass Credit Rating Downgrades 
In the years leading up to the financial crisis, Moody’s and S&P together issued 

investment grade ratings for tens of thousands of RMBS and CDO securities, earning substantial 
sums for issuing these ratings.  In mid-2007, however, both credit rating agencies suddenly 
reversed course and began downgrading hundreds, then thousands of RMBS and CDO ratings.  
These mass downgrades shocked the financial markets, contributed to the collapse of the 
subprime RMBS and CDO secondary markets, triggered sales of assets that had lost investment 
grade status, and damaged holdings of financial firms worldwide.  Perhaps more than any other 
single event, the sudden mass downgrades of RMBS and CDO ratings were the immediate 
trigger for the financial crisis. 

 

 
 

 

To understand why the credit rating agencies suddenly reversed course and how their 

RMBS and CDO ratings downgrades impacted the financial markets, it is useful to review trends 
in the housing and mortgage backed security markets in the years leading up to the crisis. 

(1) Increasing High Risk Loans and Unaffordable Housing   
The years prior to the financial crisis saw increasing numbers of borrowers buying not 
only more homes than usual, but higher priced homes, requiring larger and more frequent loans 
that were constantly refinanced.  By 2005, about 69% of Americans had purchased homes, the 
largest percentage in American history.1005  In the five-year period running up to 2006, the 
median home price, adjusted for inflation, increased 50 percent.1006   The pace of home price 
appreciation was on an unsustainable trajectory, as is illustrated by the chart below.1007

Subprime lending fueled the overall growth in housing demand and housing price 

 
 
increases that began in the late 1990s and ran through mid-2006.1008  “Between 2000 and 2007, 
backers of subprime mortgage-backed securities – primarily Wall Street and European 
investment banks – underwrote $2.1 trillion worth of [subprime mortgage backed securities] 
business, according to data from trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance.”1009  By 2006, 
subprime lending made up 13.5% of mortgage lending in the United States, a fivefold increase 
from 2001.1010   The graph below reflects the unprecedented growth in subprime mortgages 
between 2003 and 2006.1011

To enable subprime borrowers to buy homes that they would not traditionally qualify for, 
lenders began using exotic mortgage products that reduced or eliminated the need for large down 
payments and allowed monthly mortgage payments that reflected less than the fully amortized 
cost of the loan.  For example, some types of mortgages allowed borrowers to obtain loans for 
100% of the cost of a house; make monthly payments that covered only the interest owed on the 
loan; or pay artificially low initial interest rates on loans that could be refinanced before higher 
interest rates took effect.  In 2006, Barron’s reported that first-time home buyers put no money 
down 43% of the time in 2005; interest only loans made up approximately 33% of new 
mortgages and home equity loans in 2005, up from 0.6% in 2000; by 2005, 15% of borrowers 
owed at least 10% more than their home was worth; and more than $2.5 trillion in adjustable rate 
mortgages were due to reset to higher interest rates in 2006 and 2007.1012

 

These new mortgage products were not confined to subprime borrowers; they were also 
offered to prime borrowers who used them to purchase expensive homes.  Many borrowers also 
used them to refinance their homes and take out cash against their homes’ increased value.  
Lenders also increased their issuance of home equity loans and lines of credit that offered low

Subprime loans, Alt A mortgages that required little or no documentation, and home 

equity loans all posed a greater risk of default than traditional 30-year, fixed rate mortgages.  By 
2006, the combined market share of these higher risk home loans totaled nearly 50% of all 
mortgage originations.

1014

 

At the same time housing prices and high risk loans were increasing, the National 

 
Association of Realtors’ housing affordability index showed that, by 2006, housing had become 
less affordable than at any point in the previous 20 years, as presented in the graph below.
The “affordability index” measures how easy it is for a typical family to afford a typical 
mortgage.  Higher numbers mean that homes are more affordable, while lower numbers mean 
that homes are generally less affordable. 

1015

  

 

By the end of 2006, the concentration of higher risk loans for less affordable homes had set the 
stage for an unprecedented number of credit rating downgrades on mortgage related securities.

(2)  Mass Downgrades 

 

263 

 

Although ratings downgrades for investment grade securities are supposed to be 

relatively infrequent, in 2007, they took place on a massive scale that was unprecedented in U.S. 
financial markets.  Beginning in July 2007, Moody’s and S&P downgraded hundreds and then 
thousands of RMBS and CDO ratings, causing the rated securities to lose value and become 
much more difficult to sell, and leading to the subsequent collapse of the RMBS and CDO 
secondary markets.  The massive downgrades made it clear that the original ratings were not 
only deeply flawed, but the U.S. mortgage market was much riskier than previously portrayed.   

 
Housing prices peaked in 2006.  In late 2006, as the increase in housing prices slowed or 

leveled out, refinancing became more difficult, and delinquencies in subprime residential 
mortgages began to multiply.  By January 2007, nearly 10% of all subprime loans were 
delinquent, a 68% increase from January 2006.1016
exposing more borrowers who had purchased homes that they could not afford and could no 
longer refinance.  Subprime lenders also began to close their doors, which the U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development marked as the beginning of economic trouble: 

  Housing prices then began to decline, 

  

 
“Arguably, the first tremors of the national mortgage crisis were felt in early December 
2006 when two sizeable subprime lenders, Ownit Mortgage Solutions and Sebring 
Capital, failed.  The Wall Street Journal described the closing of these firms as ‘sending 
shock waves’ through the mortgage-bond market.  …  By late February 2007 when the 
number of subprime lenders shuttering their doors had reached 22, one of the first 
headlines announcing the onset of a ‘mortgage crisis’ appeared in the Daily Telegraph of 
London.”1017
 
During the first half of 2007, despite the news of failing subprime lenders and increasing 
subprime mortgage defaults, Moody’s and S&P continued to issue AAA credit ratings for a large 
number of RMBS and CDO securities.  In the first week of July 2007 alone, S&P issued over 
1,500 new RMBS ratings, a number that almost equaled the average number of RMBS ratings it 
issued in each of the preceding three months.1018  From July 5 to July 11, 2007, Moody’s issued 
approximately 675 new RMBS ratings, nearly double its weekly average in the prior month.1019
  
The timing of this surge of new ratings on the eve of the mass downgrades is troubling, and 
raises serious questions about whether S&P and Moody’s quickly pushed these ratings through 
to avoid losing revenues before the mass downgrades began.

In the second week of July 2007, S&P and Moody’s initiated the first of several mass 

rating downgrades, shocking the financial markets.  On July 10, S&P placed on credit watch, the 
ratings of 612 subprime RMBS with an original value of $7.35 billion,1020 and two days later 
downgraded 498 of these securities.1021  On July 10, Moody’s downgraded 399 subprime RMBS 
with an original value of $5.2 billion.1022  By the end of July, S&P had downgraded more than 
1,000 RMBS and almost 100 CDO securities.1023
unprecedented in U.S. financial markets. 

  This volume of rating downgrades was 

 
The downgrades created significant turmoil in the securitization markets, as investors 
were required to sell off RMBS and CDO securities that had lost their investment grade status, 
RMBS and CDO securities in the investment portfolios of financial firms lost much of their 
value, and new securitizations were unable to find investors.  The subprime RMBS secondary 
market initially froze and then collapsed, leaving financial firms around the world holding 
suddenly unmarketable subprime RMBS securities that were plummeting in value.1024

  

 
Neither Moody’s nor S&P produced any meaningful contemporaneous documentation 

explaining their decisions to issue mass downgrades in July 2007, disclosing how the mass 
downgrades by the two companies happened to occur two days apart, or analyzing the possible 
impact of their actions on the financial markets.  When Moody’s CEO, Raymond McDaniel, was 
asked about the July downgrades, he indicated that he could not recall any aspect of the decision-
making process.1025  He told the Subcommittee that he was merely informed that the downgrades 
would occur, but was not personally involved in the decision.1026

to this letter, the July downgrades were not the first to take place during 2007.  The letter reports that, altogether in 
the first six months of 2007, S&P downgraded 739 RMBS and 25 CDOs.  These downgrades, however, took place 
on multiple days over a six-month period.   Prior to July, Moody’s had downgraded approximately 480 RMBS 
during the first six months of 2007 (this figure was calculated by the Subcommittee based on information from 
Moody’s “Structured Finance: Changes & Confirmations” reports for that time period).

Although neither Moody’s nor S&P produced documentation on its internal decision-

making process related to the mass downgrades, one bank, UBS, produced an email in 
connection with a court case indicating that Moody’s was meeting with a series of investment 
banks to discuss the upcoming downgrades.  In an email dated July 5, 2007, five days before the 
mass downgrades began, a UBS banker sent an email to a colleague about a meeting with 
Moody’s: 

 
“I just got off the phone with David Oman ….  Apparently they’re meeting w/ Moodys to 
discuss impacts of ABS subprime downgrades, etc.  Has he been in contact with the 
[UBS] Desk?  It sounds like Moodys is trying to figure out when to start downgrading, 
and how much damage they’re going to cause – they’re meeting with various investment 
banks.”1027
 

  

It is unclear how much notice Moody’s or S&P provided to investment banks regarding their 
planned actions. 
 

One senior executive at S&P, Ian Bell, the head of European structured finance ratings, 
provided his own views in a post-mortem analysis a few days after the initial downgrades.  He 
expressed frustration and concern that S&P had mishandled its public explanation of the mass 
downgrades, writing: 

 
“[O]ne aspect of our handling of the subprime that really concerns me is what I 
see as our arrogance in our messaging.  Maybe it is because I am away from the 
center of the action and so have more of an ‘outsider’s’ point of view.  … 
 
I listened to the telecon TWICE.  That guy [who asked a question about the 
timing of the mass downgrades] was not a ‘jerk’.  He asked an entirely legitimate 
question that we should have anticipated.  He then got upset when we totally 
fluffed our answer.  We did sound like the Nixon White House.  Instead of 
dismissing people like him or assuming some dark motive on their part, we should 
ask ourselves how we could have so mishandled the answer to such an obvious 
question. 
 
I have thought for awhile now that if this company suffers from an Arthur 
Andersen event, we will not be brought down by a lack of ethics as I have never 
seen an organisation more ethical, nor will it be by greed as this plays so little role 
in our motivations; it will be arrogance.”1028

  

 

In August 2007, Eric Kolchinsky, a managing director of Moody’s CDO analysts, sent an 
urgent email to his superiors about the pressures to rate still more new CDOs in the midst of the 
mass downgrades: 
                                                 
1027 7/5/2007 email from David Goldsteen (UBS) to Dayna Corlito (UBS), “ABS Subprime & Moody’s 
downgrades,” UBS-CT 021485, Hearing Exhibit 4/23-94o. 
1028 7/13/2007 internal S&P email from Ian Bell to Tom Gillis and Joanne Rose, Hearing Exhibit 4/23-54a. 

266 

 

“[E]ach of our current deals is in crisis mode.  This is compounded by the fact that we 
have introduced new criteria for ABS CDOs.  Our changes are a response to the fact that 
we are already putting deals closed in the spring on watch for downgrade.  This is 
unacceptable and we cannot rate the new deals in the same away [sic] we have done 
before. ...  [B]ankers are under enormous pressure to turn their warehouses into CDO 
notes.”1029

 

 
Both Moody’s and S&P continued to rate new CDO securities despite their companies’ 
accelerating downgrades. 
     

In October 2007, Moody’s began downgrading CDOs on a daily basis, using the month to 
downgrade more than 270 CDO securities with an original value of $10 billion.1030  In December 
2007, Moody’s downgraded another $14 billion in CDOs, and placed another $105 billion on 
credit watch.  Moody’s calculated that, overall in 2007, “8725 ratings from 2116 deals were 
downgraded and 1954 ratings from 732 deals were upgraded,” which means it issued four times 
as many downgrades as upgrades.1031  S&P calculated that, during the second half of 2007, it 
downgraded over 9,000 RMBS ratings.1032

 

 

 
The downgrades continued into 2008.  On January 30, 2008, S&P took action on over 

6,300 subprime RMBS securities and over 1,900 CDO securities – meaning it either downgraded 
their ratings or placed the securities on credit watch with negative implications.  The affected 
RMBS and CDO securities represented issuance amounts of approximately $270.1 billion and 
$263.9 billion, respectively.1033

   

The rating downgrades affected a wide range of RMBS and CDO securities.  Some of the 

downgraded securities had been rated years earlier; others had received AAA ratings less than 12 
months before.  For example, in April 2007, both Moody’s and S&P gave AAA ratings to three 
tranches of approximately $1.5 billion in a cash CDO known as Vertical ABS CDO 2007-1.  Six 
months later, the majority of the CDO’s tranches were downgraded to junk status; in 2008, the 
CDO’s ratings were withdrawn, it assets were liquidated, and the AAA rated securities became 
worthless.  In another case, in February and March 2007, Moody’s and S&P gave AAA ratings 
to 5 tranches of about a $1 billion RMBS securitization known as GSAMP Trust 2007-FM2.  In 
late 2007, both credit rating agencies began downgrading the securities; by 2008, they began

email sent in the midst of these CDO downgrades, one Moody’s analyst commented to a colleague:  “You’re right

downgrading the AAA rated securities, and by August 2009 S&P had downgraded all its 
tranches to noninvestment grade or junk status.   

 

One more striking example involved a $1.6 billion hybrid CDO known as Delphinus 

CDO 2007-1, Ltd., which was downgraded a few months after its rating was issued.  Moody’s 
gave AAA ratings to seven of its tranches and S&P to six tranches in July and August 2007, 
respectively, but began downgrading its securities by the end of the year, and by the end of 2008, 
had fully downgraded its AAA rated securities to junk status.1034

 

 
Analysts have determined that, by 2010, over 90% of subprime RMBS securities issued 

in 2006 and 2007 and originally rated AAA had been downgraded to junk status by Moody’s and 
S&P.1035

D.  Ratings Deficiencies 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

The Subcommittee’s investigation uncovered a host of factors responsible for the 

inaccurate credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and S&P to RMBS and CDO securities.  Those 
factors include the drive for market share, pressure from investment banks to inflate ratings, 
inaccurate rating models, and inadequate rating and surveillance resources.  In addition, federal 
regulations that limited certain financial institutions to the purchase of investment grade financial 
instruments encouraged investment banks and investors to pursue and credit rating agencies to 
provide those top ratings.  All these factors played out against the backdrop of an ongoing 
conflict of interest that arose from how the credit rating agencies earned their income.  If the

Behavior of Market Constituents,” University of Westminster - School of Law International Finance Review

94.2% of the subprime RMBS issues it rated in 2006, including 100% of the 2006 RMBS backed by second-lien 
loans, and 76.9% of the issues rated in 2007.  In its rating transition report, S&P wrote that it had downgraded 
44.3% of the subprime tranches it rated between the first quarter of 2005 and the third quarter of 2007.”)

credit rating agencies had issued ratings that accurately exposed the increasing risk in the RMBS 
and CDO markets, they may have discouraged investors from purchasing those securities, 
slowed the pace of securitizations, and as a result reduced their own profits.  It was not in the 
short term economic self-interest of either Moody’s or S&P to provide accurate credit risk 
ratings for high risk RMBS and CDO securities. 

 
(1)  Awareness of Increasing Credit Risks 
The evidence shows that analysts within Moody’s and S&P were aware of the increasing 
risks in the mortgage market in the years leading up to the financial crisis, including higher risk 
mortgage products, increasingly lax lending standards, poor quality loans, unsustainable housing 
prices, and increasing mortgage fraud.  Yet for years, neither credit rating agency heeded 
warnings – even their own – about the need to adjust their processes to accurately reflect the 
increasing credit risk. 

 
Moody’s and S&P began issuing public warnings about problems in the mortgage market 

as early as 2003, yet continued to issue inflated ratings for RMBS and CDO securities before 
abruptly reversing course in July 2007.  Moody’s CEO testified before the House Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform, for example, that Moody’s had been warning the market 
continuously since 2003, about the deterioration in lending standards and inflated housing prices.   

 
“Beginning in July 2003, we published warnings about the increased risks we saw and 
took action to adjust our assumptions for the portions of the residential mortgage backed 
securities (“RMBS”) market that we were asked to rate.”1036
 

  

Both S&P and Moody’s published a number of articles indicating the potential for deterioration 
in RMBS performance.1037
  For example, in September 2005, S&P published a report entitled, 
“Who Will Be Left Holding the Bag?”  The report contained this strong warning:  
 

“It’s a question that comes to mind whenever one price increase after another – say, for 
ridiculously expensive homes – leaves each succeeding buyer out on the end of a longer

McDaniel prepared statement at 13-14.  In addition, in March 2007 Moody’s warned of the possible effect that 
downgrades of subprime mortgage backed securities might have on its structured finance CDOs.  See 3/2007 “The 
Impact of Subprime Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities on Moody’s-Rated Structured Finance CDOs: A 
Preliminary Review,” Moody’s.

and longer limb:  When the limb finally breaks, who’s going to get hurt?  In the red-hot 
U.S. housing market, that’s no longer a theoretical riddle.  Investors are starting to ask 
which real estate vehicles carry the most risk – and if mortgage defaults surge, who will 
end up suffering the most.”1038

 

Internal Moody’s and S&P emails further demonstrate that senior management and 

ratings personnel were aware of the deteriorating mortgage market and increasing credit risk.  In 
June 2005, for example, an outside mortgage broker who had seen the head of S&P’s RMBS 
Group, Susan Barnes, on a television program sent her an email warning about the “seeds of 
destruction” in the financial markets.  He noted that no one at the time seemed interested in 
fixing the looming problems:  

“I have contacted the OTS, FDIC and others and my concerns are not addressed.  I have 
been a mortgage broker for the past 13 years and I have never seen such a lack of 
attention to loan risk.  I am confident our present housing bubble is not from supply and 
demand of housing, but from money supply.  In my professional opinion the biggest 
perpetrator is Washington Mutual.  1) No income documentation loans. 2) Option ARMS 
(negative amortization) ... 5) 100% financing loans.  I have seen instances where WAMU 
approved buyers for purchase loans; where the fully indexed interest only payments 
represented 100% of borrower’s gross monthly income.  We need to stop this 
madness!!!”1039

  

Several email chains among S&P employees in the Servicer Evaluation Group in 

Structured Finance demonstrate a clear awareness of mortgage market problems.  One from 
September 2006, for example, with the subject line “Nightmare Mortgages,” contains an 
exchange with startling frankness and foresight.  One S&P employee circulated an article on 
mortgage problems, stating:  “Interesting Business Week article on Option ARMs, quoting 
anecdotes involving some of our favorite servicers.”  Another responded:  “This is frightening. It 
wreaks of greed, unregulated brokers, and ‘not so prudent’ lenders.”
commenting on the same article said:  “I’m surprised the OCC and FDIC doesn’t come 
downharder [sic] on these guys - this is like another banking crisis potentially looming!!”1041

1040 Another employee 

 
Another email chain that same month shows that at least some employees understood the 
significance of problems within the mortgage market nine months before the mass downgrades 
began.  One S&P employee wrote:  “I think [a circulated article is] telling us that underwriting 
fraud; appraisal fraud and the general appetite for new product among originators is resulting in 
loans being made that shouldn’t be made. … [I]f [Eliot] Spitzer [then-New York Attorney 
General] could prove coercion this could be a RICO offense!”  A colleague responded that the

In a third email chain from August 2006, commenting on an article about problems in the 

 
mortgage market, a director in the S&P Servicer Evaluation Group wrote:  “I’m not surprised; 
there has been rampant appraisal and underwriting fraud in the industry for quite some time as

pressure has mounted to feed the origination machine.”

Mortgage Standards”:  “Pretty grim news as we suspected – note also the ‘mailing in the keys 
and walking away’ epidemic has begun – I think things are going to get mighty ugly next 
year!”1044  Still another S&P email the same month circulated an article entitled, “Home Prices 
Keep Sliding; Buyers Sit Tight,” and remarked:  “[J]ust curious...are there ever any positive 
repo[r]ts on the housing market?”1045

   

An email among several S&P employees a few months later circulated an article entitled, 

“The Mortgage Mess Spreads” with one person noting ominously:  “This is like watching a 
hurricane from FL [Florida] moving up the coast slowly towards us.  Not sure if we will get hit 
in full or get trounced a bit or escape without severe damage ....”

1046

  

         Government Warnings.   At the same time the credit rating agencies were publishing 
reports and circulating articles internally about the deteriorating mortgage market, several 
government agencies issued public warnings about lax lending standards and increasing 
mortgage fraud.  A 2004 quarterly report by the FDIC, for example, sounded an alarm over the 
likelihood of more high risk loan delinquencies: 

 “[I]t is unlikely that home prices are poised to plunge nationwide, even when mortgage 
rates rise .... The greater risk to insured institutions is the potential for increased credit 
delinquencies and losses among highly leveraged, subprime, and ARM borrowers.  These

high-risk segments of mortgage lending may drive overall mortgage loss rates higher if 
home prices decline or interest rates rise.”1047

   

 

In 2005, in its 11th Annual Survey on Credit Underwriting Practices, the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which oversees nationally chartered banks, described a 
significant lowering of retail lending standards, noting it was the first time in the survey’s history 
that a net lowering of retail lending practices had been observed.  The OCC wrote: 
  

“Retail lending has undergone a dramatic transformation in recent years as banks have 
aggressively moved into the retail arena to solidify market positions and gain market 
share.  Higher credit limits and loan-to-value ratios, lower credit scores, lower minimum 
payments, more revolving debt, less documentation and verification, and lengthening 
amortizations - have introduced more risk to retail portfolios.”1048
 
Starting in 2004, federal law enforcement agencies also issued multiple warnings about 

 
fraud in the mortgage marketplace.  For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
made national headlines when it warned that mortgage fraud had the potential to be a national 
epidemic,1049 and issued a 2004 report describing how mortgage fraud was becoming more 
prevalent.  The report noted:  “Criminal activity has become more complex and loan frauds are 
expanding to multitransactional frauds involving groups of people from top management to 
industry professionals who assist in the loan application process.”1050
  The FBI also testified 
about the problem before Congress: 
 

 

“The potential impact of mortgage fraud on financial institutions and the stock market is 
clear.  If fraudulent practices become systemic within the mortgage industry and 
mortgage fraud is allowed to become unrestrained, it will ultimately place financial 
institutions at risk and have adverse effects on the stock market.”1051
 

 

In 2006, the FBI reported that the number of Suspicious Activity Reports describing mortgage 
fraud had risen significantly since 2001.1052

The FBI’s fraud warnings were repeated by industry analysts.  The Mortgage Bankers 

Association’s Mortgage Asset Research Institute (MARI), for example, had been reporting 
increasing fraud in mortgages for years.  In April 2007, MARI reported a 30% increase in 2006 
in loans with suspected mortgage fraud.  The report also noted that while 55% of overall fraud 
incidents reported to MARI involved loan application fraud, the percentage of subprime loans 
with loan application fraud was even higher at 65%.1053

 

Press Reports.  Warnings in the national press concerning the threat posed by 

deteriorating mortgages and unsustainable housing prices were also prevalent.  A University of 
Florida website has collected dozens of these articles, many of which were published in 2005.  
The headlines include:  “Fed Debates Pricking the U.S. Housing ‘Bubble’,” New York Times, 
May 31, 2005; “Yale Professor Predicts Housing ‘Bubble’ Will Burst,” NPR, June 3, 2005;

Had Moody’s and S&P heeded their own warnings as well as the warnings in government 
 
reports and the national press, they might have issued more conservative, including fewer AAA, 
ratings for RMBS and CDO securities from 2005 to 2007; required additional credit 
enhancements earlier; and issued ratings downgrades earlier and with greater frequency, 
gradually letting the air out of the housing bubble instead of puncturing it with the mass 
downgrades that began in July 2007.  The problem, however, was that neither company had a 
financial incentive to assign tougher credit ratings to the very securities that for a short while 
increased their revenues, boosted their stock prices, and expanded their executive compensation.  
Instead, ongoing conflicts of interest, inaccurate credit rating models, and inadequate rating and 
surveillance resources made it possible for Moody’s and S&P to ignore their own warnings about 
the U.S. mortgage market.  In the longer run, these decisions cost both companies dearly.  
Between January 2007 and January 2009, the stock price for both The McGraw-Hill Companies 
(S&P’s parent company) and Moody’s fell nearly 70%, and neither share price has fully 
recovered.   

(2)  CRA Conflicts of Interest 
In transitioning from the fact that the rating agencies issued inaccurate ratings to the 
question of why they did, one of the primary issues is the conflicts of interest inherent in the 
“issuer-pays” model.  Under this system, the firm interested in profiting from an RMBS or CDO 
security is required to pay for the credit rating needed to sell the security.  Moreover, it requires 
the credit rating agencies to obtain business from the very companies paying for their rating

judgment.  The result is a system that creates strong incentives for the rating agencies to inflate 
their ratings to attract business, and for the issuers and arrangers of the securities to engage in 
“ratings shopping” to obtain the highest ratings for their financial products.   

 
The conflict of interest inherent in an issuer-pay setup is clear:  rating agencies are 

incentivized to offer the highest ratings, as opposed to offering the most accurate ratings, in order 
to attract business.  It is much like a person trying to sell a home and hiring a third-party 
appraiser to make sure it is worth the price.  Only, with the credit rating agencies, it is the seller 
who hires the appraiser on behalf of the buyer – the result is a misalignment of interests.  This 
system, currently permitted by the SEC, underlies the “issuers-pay” model.  

  
The credit rating agencies assured Congress and the investing public that they could 

“manage” these conflicts, but the evidence indicates that the drive for market share and 
increasing revenues, ratings shopping, and investment bank pressures have undermined the 
ratings process and the quality of the ratings themselves.  Multiple former Moody’s and S&P 
employees told the Subcommittee that, in the years leading up to the financial crisis, gaining 
market share, increasing revenues, and pleasing investment bankers bringing business to the firm 
assumed a higher priority than issuing accurate RMBS and CDO credit ratings.   
 

(a)  Drive for Market Share 

 

Prior to the explosive growth in revenues generated from the ratings of mortgage backed 

 
securities, the credit rating agencies had a reputation for exercising independent judgment and 
taking pride in requiring the information and performing the analysis needed to issue accurate 
credit ratings.   A journalist captured the rating agency culture in a 1995 article when she wrote:  
“Ask a [company’s] treasurer for his opinion of rating agencies, and he’ll probably rank them 
somewhere between a trip to the dentist and an IRS audit.  You can’t control them, and you can’t 
escape them.”1055
 

   

But a number of analysts who worked for Moody’s during the 1990s and into the new 

decade told the Subcommittee that a major cultural shift took place at the company around 2000.  
They told the Subcommittee that, prior to 2000, Moody’s was academically oriented and 
conservative in its issuance of ratings.  That changed, according to those interviewed, with the 
rise of Brian Clarkson who worked at Moody’s from 1990 to 2008, and rose from Group 
Managing Director of the Global Asset Backed Finance Group to President and Chief Operating 
Officer of Moody’s.  These employees indicated that during Mr. Clarkson’s tenure Moody’s 
began to focus less on striving for accurate credit ratings, and more on increasing market share 
and “servicing the client,” who was identified as the investment banks that brought business to 
the firm. 

This testimonial evidence that increasing revenues gained importance is corroborated by 
documents obtained by the Subcommittee during the course of its investigation.  For example, in 
a March 2000 email, the head of Moody’s Structured Finance Group in Paris wrote that she was 
                                                 
1055 “Rating the Rating Agencies,” Treasury and Risk Management (7/1995).

leaving the firm, because she was uncomfortable with “the lack of a strategy I can clearly 
understand, other than maximize the market share and the gross margin with insufficient 
resources.”1056  A 2002 Moody’s survey of the Structured Finance Group (SFG) also documents 
the shift, finding that most employees who responded to the survey indicated that SFG business 
objectives included:  generating increased revenue; increasing market share; fostering good 
relationships with issuers and investors; and delivering high quality ratings and research.  
According to the survey results:  “When asked about how business objectives were translated 
into day-to-day work, most agreed that writing deals was paramount, while writing research and 
developing new products and services received less emphasis.  Most agreed that there was a 
strong emphasis on relationships with issuers and investment bankers.”1057

   

A 2003 email sent by Mr. Clarkson to one of his senior managers about the performance 

of the Structured Finance Real Estate and Derivatives Group further demonstrates the firm’s 
emphasis on market share.  Mr. Clarkson wrote: 

“Noel and his team handled the increase and met or exceeded almost every financial and 
market share objective and goal for his Group. … Through November total revenue for 
Noel’s Group has grown 16% compared with budgeted growth of 10% with CMBS 
[Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities] up 19% and Derivatives up 14%.  This was 
achieved by taking advantage of increased CMBS issuance volumes and by meeting or 
slightly exceeding market share objectives for the Group.  The Derivatives team has 
achieved a year to date 96% market share compared to a target share of 95%.  This is 
down approximately 2% from 2002 primarily due to not rating Insurance TRUP CDO’s 
and rating less subordinated tranches.  Noel’s team is considering whether we need to 
refine our approach to these securities.  The CMBS team was able to meet their target 
share of 75%.  However this was down from 84% market share in 2002 primarily due to 
competitor’s [sic] easing their standards to capture share.”1058

 

This performance analysis notes that the team being reviewed put up a strong performance 
despite competitors “easing their standards to capture [market] share.”  It also notes that for 
certain CDOs and “less subordinated tranches,” Moody’s might “need to refine our approach.”   
The clear emphasis of the analysis is increasing revenues and meeting “market share objectives,” 
and appears silent with regard to issuing accurate ratings. 

One former Moody’s senior vice president, Mark Froeba, told the Subcommittee that Mr. 

Clarkson used fear and intimidation tactics to make analysts spend less time on the ratings 
process and work more cooperatively with investment bankers.1059
  At the Subcommittee 
hearing, another former Moody’s senior analyst, Richard Michalek, described a meeting that he

had with Mr. Clarkson shortly after he was promoted to head of the Structured Finance Group.  
Mr. Michalek stated: 

275 

 

 

“In my ‘discussion,’ I was told that he [Mr. Clarkson] had met with the investment banks 
to learn how our Group was working with the various clients and whether there were any 
analysts who were either particularly difficult or particularly valuable.  I was named … as 
two of the more ‘difficult’ analysts who had a reputation for making ‘too many’ 
comments on the deal documentation. 

The conversation was quite uncomfortable, and it didn’t improve when he described how 
he had previously had to fire [another analyst], a former leader of the Asset-Backed 
group who he otherwise considered a ‘good guy.’  He described how, because of the 
numerous complaints he had received about [that analyst’s] extreme conservatism, 
rigidity and insensitivity to client perspective, he was left with no choice.  …  He then 
asked me to convince him why he shouldn’t fire me. … [T]he primary message of the 
conversation was plain:  further complaints from the ‘customers’ would very likely 
abruptly end my career at Moody’s.”1060

 

 

 

 

 

 
Several former Moody’s employees have testified that Moody’s employees were fired 
when they challenged senior management with a more conservative approach to rating RMBS 
and CDO securities.  According to Mr. Froeba: 
 

“[T]he fear was real, not rare and not at all healthy.  You began to hear of analysts, even 
whole groups of analysts, at Moody’s who had lost their jobs because they were doing 
their jobs, identifying risks and describing them accurately.”1061

 

A former Managing Director, Eric Kolchinsky, one of the senior managers in charge of the 
business line which rated subprime backed CDOs at Moody’s stated:  
 

“Managers of rating groups were expected by their supervisors and ultimately the Board 
of Directors of Moody’s to build, or at least maintain, market share.  It was an unspoken 
understanding that loss of market share would cause a manager to lose his or her job.”1062

 

He described how market share concerns were addressed: 
 

“Senior management would periodically distribute emails detailing their departments’ 
market share.  These emails were limited to Managing Directors only.  Even if the market 
share dropped by a few percentage points, managers would be expected to justify

‘missing’ the deals which were not rated.  Colleagues have described enormous pressure 
from their superiors when their market share dipped.”1063

  

A Moody’s email sent in early October 2007 to Managing Directors of the CDO Group 

 
 
illustrates the intense pressure placed on CDO analysts to retain or increase market share, even in 
the midst of the onset of the financial crisis.1064
 

  This email reported that for CDOs: 

“Market share by deal count [had] dropped to 94%, though by volume it’s 97%.  It’s 
lower than the 98+% in prior quarters.  Any reason for concern, are issuers being more 
selective to control costs (is Fitch cheaper?) or is it an aberration[?]”1065

   

This email was sent during the same period when Moody’s began downgrading CDOs on a daily 
basis, eventually downgrading almost 1,500 CDO securities with an original value likely in the 
tens of billions in the last three months of 2007 alone.  Despite the internal recognition at 
Moody’s that previously rated CDOs were at substantial risk for downgrades, the email shows 
management pressing the CDO Managing Directors about losing a few points of market share in 
the middle of an accelerating ratings disaster. 

 

 

276 

 

The drive for market share was similarly emphasized at S&P.  One former S&P 

 
Managing Director in charge of the RMBS Ratings Group described it as follows: 
 

“By 2004 the structured finance department at S&P was a major source of revenue and 
profit for the parent company, McGraw-Hill.  Focus was directed at collecting market 
share and revenue data on a monthly basis from the various structured finance rating 
groups and forwarded to the finance staff at S&P.”1066

  

 
Numerous internal emails illustrate not only S&P’s drive to maintain or increase market share, 
but also how that pressure negatively impacted the ratings process, placing revenue concerns 
ahead of ratings quality.  For example, in a 2004 email, S&P management discussed the 
possibility of changing its CDO ratings criteria in response to an “ongoing threat of losing 
deals”:   
 

“We are meeting with your group this week to discuss adjusting criteria for rating 
CDOs of real estate assets this week because of the ongoing threat of losing 
deals.”1067

On another occasion, in response to a 2005 email stating that S&P’s ratings model 

 
A 2004 email chain among members of the S&P Analytical Policy Board, which set 

needed to be adjusted to account for the higher risks associated with subprime loans, a director in 
RMBS research, Frank Parisi, wrote that S&P could have released a different ratings model, 
LEVELS 6.0, months ago “if we didn’t have to massage the sub-prime and Alt-A numbers to 
preserve market share.”1068  This same director wrote in an email a month later:  “Screwing with 
criteria to ‘get the deal’ is putting the entire S&P franchise at risk – it’s a bad idea.”1069
 
 
standards to ensure integrity for the ratings process, provides additional evidence of how market 
share concerns affected the credit ratings process.  In that chain of emails, a senior S&P 
manager, Gale Scott, openly expressed concern about how a criteria change could impact market 
share and cause S&P to lose business.  Ms. Scott wrote:  “I am trying to ascertain whether we 
can determine at this point if we will suffer any loss of business because of our decision and if 
so, how much?  We should have an effective way of measuring the impact of our decision over 
time.”1070
business, she reiterated her concerns, noting, “I think the criteria process must include 
appropriate testing and feedback from the marketplace.”  
 

  After a colleague reassured her that he did not believe it would cause a loss of 

  

On another occasion, an August 2006 email reveals the frustration that at least one S&P 

employee in the Servicer Evaluation Group felt about the dependence of his employer on the 
issuers of structured finance products, going so far as to describe the rating agencies as having “a  
kind of Stockholm syndrome” – the phenomenon in which a captive begins to identify with the 
captor:   
 
“They’ve become so beholden to their top issuers for revenue they have all developed a 
kind of Stockholm syndrome which they mistakenly tag as Customer Value creation.”1071

 

 

In October 2007, Moody’s Chief Credit Officer explicitly raised concerns at the highest 

levels of the firm that it was losing market share “[w]ith the loosening of the traditional duopoly” 
between Moody’s and S&P, noting that Fitch was becoming an “acceptable substitute.”1072  In a 
memorandum entitled, “Credit Policy issues at Moody’s suggested by the subprime/liquidity 
crisis,” the author set out to answer the question, “how do rating agencies compete?” 1073
  The 
candid reflection noted that in an ideal situation “ratings quality” would be paramount, but the 
need to maintain, and even increase, market share, coupled with pressures exerted by the 
companies seeking credit ratings, were also affecting the quality of its ratings.  Moody’s Chief 
Credit Officer wrote the following lament:  
                                                 
1068 3/23/2005 email from Frank Parisi to Thomas Warrack, and others, Hearing Exhibit 4/23-5.

Exhibit 4/23-14.   
1072 10/21/2007 Moody’s internal email, Hearing Exhibit 4/23-24b.  Although this email is addressed to and from the 
CEO, the Chief Credit Officer told the Subcommittee that he wrote the memorandum attached to the email.  
Subcommittee interview of Andy Kimball (4/15/2010).

“Analysts and MDs [Managing Directors] are continually ‘pitched’ by bankers, issuers, 
investors – all with reasonable arguments – whose views can color credit judgment, 
sometimes improving it, other times degrading it (we ‘drink the kool-aid’).  Coupled with 
strong internal emphasis on market share & margin focus, this does constitute a ‘risk’ to 
ratings quality.”1074

   

 
By the time his memorandum was written, both Moody’s and S&P were already issuing 
thousands of RMBS and CDO rating downgrades, admitting that their prior investment grade 
ratings had not accurately reflected the risk that these investments would fail. 
 

(b)  Investment Bank Pressure 

 

At the same time Moody’s and S&P were pressuring their RMBS and CDO analysts to 
increase market share and revenues, the investment banks responsible for bringing RMBS and 
CDO business to the firms were pressuring those same analysts to ease rating standards.  Former 
Moody’s and S&P analysts and managers interviewed by the Subcommittee described, for 
example, how investment bankers pressured them to get their deals done quickly, increase the 
size of the tranches that received AAA ratings, and reduce the credit enhancements protecting 
the AAA tranches from loss.  They also pressed the CRA analysts and managers to ignore a host 
of factors that could be seen as increasing credit risk.  Sometimes described as “ratings 
shopping,” the analysts described how some investment bankers threatened to take their business 
to another credit rating agency if they did not get the favorable treatment they wanted.  The 
evidence collected by the Subcommittee indicates that the pressure exerted by investment banks 
frequently impacted the ratings process, enabling the banks to obtain more favorable treatment 
than they otherwise would have received.   
 
 
email in which a UBS banker warned an S&P senior manager not to use a new, more 
conservative rating model for CDOs.  He wrote: 
 

The type of blatant pressure exerted by some investment bankers is captured in a 2006 

“[H]eard you guys are revising your residential mbs [mortgage backed security] rating 
methodology - getting very punitive on silent seconds.  [H]eard your ratings could be 5 
notches back of [Moody’s] equivalent.  [G]onna kill your resi[dential] biz.  [M]ay force 
us to do moodyfitch only cdos!”1075
 

   

When asked by his colleague about the change in the model, an S&P senior manager, Thomas 
Warrack, noted that the new model “took a more conservative approach” that would result in 
“raising our credit support requirements going forward,” but Mr. Warrack was also quick to add:  
“We certainly did [not] intend to do anything to bump us off a significant amount of deals.”1076

In another instance in May 2007, an S&P analyst reported to her colleagues about 

 
attempting to apply a default stress test to a CDO transaction proposed by Lehman Brothers.  She 
wrote: 
 

“[T]hey claim that their competitor investment banks are currently doing loads of deals 
that are static in the US and where no such stress is applied.  …  [W]e’d initially 
calculated some way of coming up with the stresses, by assuming the lowest rated assets 
default first ….  [T]hey claim that once they have priced the whole thing, it is possible 
that the spreads would change ….  We suggested that it was up to them to build up some 
cushion at the time they price, but they say this will always make their structures 
uneconomic and is basically unmanageable => I understand that to mean they would not 
take us on their deals.”1077
 

 

Her supervisor responded in part:  “I would recommend we do something.  Unless we have too 
many deals in US where this could hurt.”    
 
 
their ratings profitable rather than just accurate, especially when their competitor employed 
lower rating standards:  

On still another occasion in 2004, several S&P employees discussed the pressure to make 

 
“We just lost a huge Mizuho RMBS deal to Moody’s due to a huge difference in the 
required credit support level.  It’s a deal that six analysts worked through Golden Week 
so it especially hurts.  What we found from the arranger was that our support level was at 
least 10% higher than Moody’s.  …  Losing one or even several deals due to criteria 
issues, but this is so significant that it could have an impact in the future deals.  There’s 
no way we can get back on this one but we need to address this now in preparation for the 
future deals.”1078

 

 

Other emails illustrate the difficulty of upgrading the ratings models, because of the 
potential disruption to securitizations in the process of being rated.  Some investment banks 
applied various types of pressure to maintain the status quo, despite the fact that the newer 
models were considered more accurate.  In a February 2006 email to an S&P analyst, for 
example, an investment banker from Citigroup wrote:  
 

“I am VERY concerned about this E3 [new CDO rating model].  If our current 
struc[ture], which we have been marketing to investors … doesn’t work under the new 
assumptions, this will not be good.  Happy to comply, if we pass, but will ask for an 
exception if we fail.”1079

   

 

                                                 
1077 5/23/2007 email from Claire Robert to Lapo Guadagnuolo, and others, Hearing Exhibit 4/23-31. 
1078 5/25/2004 email from Yu-Tsung Chang to Joanne Rose and Pat Jordan, “Competition with Moody’s,” Hearing 
Exhibit 4/23-2. 
1079 2/16/2006 email from Edward Tang (Citigroup) to Lina Kharnak (S&P), Hearing Exhibit 4/23-8. 

280 

 

In another instance from May 2005, an investment banker from Nomura in the middle of 

finalizing a securitization raised concerns that S&P was not only failing to provide the desired 
rating, but that a new model could make the situation worse.  He wrote:   

“My desire is to keep S&P on all of my deals.  I would rather not drop S&P from the 
upcoming deal, particularly if it ends up being for only a single deal until the new model 
is in place.  Can you please review the approval process on this deal?”1080
 

   

Initially hesitant, S&P analysts ultimately decided to recommend approval of the deal in line 
with the banker’s proposal. 
 
  
example, a SunTrust Bank employee told Moody’s:   

The same pressure was applied to Moody’s analysts.  In an April 2007 email, for 

“SunTrust is disconcerted by the dramatic increase in Moody’s loss coverage levels given 
initial indications.  … Our entire team is extremely concerned. ...  Each of the other 
agencies reduced their initial levels, and the material divergence between Moody’s levels 
and the other agencies seems unreasonable and unwarranted given our superior collateral 
and minimal tail risk.”1081

   

 

 

 

 

 

On another occasion in March 2007, a Moody’s analyst emailed a colleague about 

 
problems she was having with someone at Deutsche Bank after Moody’s suggested adjustments 
to the deal:  “[The Deutsche Bank investment banker] is pushing back dearly saying that the deal 
has been marketed already and that we came back ‘too late’ with this discovery .…  She claims 
it’s hard for them to change the structure at this point.”1082

   

Special Treatment.  Documents obtained by the Subcommittee indicate that investment 

bankers who complained about rating methodologies, criteria, or decisions were often able to 
obtain exceptions or other favorable treatment.  In many instances, the decisions made by the 
credit rating agencies appeared to cross over from the healthy give and take involved in complex 
analysis to concessions made to prevent the loss of business.  While the former facilitates 
efficient transactions, the second distorts the market and hurts investors. 

In a February 2007 email directed to Moody’s, for example, a Chase investment banker 
complained that a transaction would receive a significantly lower rating than the same product 
was slated to receive from another rating agency:  “There’s going to be a three notch difference 
when we print the deal if it goes out as is.  I'm already having agita about the investor calls I’m 
going to get.”  Upon conferring with a colleague, the Moody’s manager informed the banker that 
Moody’s was able to make some changes after all:  “I spoke to Osmin earlier and confirmed that

Jason is looking into some adjustments to his [Moody’s] methodology that should be a benefit to 
you folks.”1083

   

In another instance, a difference of opinion arose between Moody’s and UBS over how to 
rate a UBS transaction known as Lancer II.  One senior Moody’s analyst wrote to her colleagues 
that, given the “time line for closing” the deal, they should side with the investment bank:  “I 
agree that what the [Moody’s rating] committee was asking is reasonable, but given the other 
modeling related issues and the time line for closing, I propose we let them go with the CDS Cp 
criteria for this deal.”1084

   

 
S&P made similar concessions while rating three deals for Bear Stearns in 2006.  An 

analyst wrote:   

 

 

 

“Bear Stearns is currently closing three deals this month which ha[ve] 40 year mortgages 
(negam) ….  There was some discrepancy in that they were giving some more credit to 
recoveries than we would like to see. … [I]t was agreed that for the deals this month we 
were OK and they would address this issue for deals going forward.”1085
  

  

While the rating process involved some level of subjective discretion, these electronic 
communications make it clear that in many cases, close calls were made in favor of the customer.  
 
 
 An exception made one time often turned into further exceptions down the road.  In 
August 2006, for example, an investment banker from Morgan Stanley tried to leverage past 
exceptions into a new one, couching his request in the context of prior deals:  
 

“When you went from [model] 2.4 to 3.0, there was a period of time where you would 
rate on either model.  I am asking for a similar ‘dual option’ window for a short period.  I 
do not think this is unreasonable.”  

A frustrated S&P manager resisted, saying: “You want this to be a commodity relationship and 
this is EXACTLY what you get.”   But even in the midst of his defense, the same S&P manager 
reminded the banker how often he had granted exceptions in other transactions:  “How many 
times have I accommodated you on tight deals?  Neer, Hill, Yoo, Garzia, Nager, May, Miteva, 
Benson, Erdman all think I am helpful, no?”1086

Some rating analysts who granted exceptions to firm policies, and then tried to limit those 
exceptions in future deals, found it difficult to do.  In June 2007, for example, a Moody’s analyst 
agreed to an exception, while warning that no exceptions would be made in future transactions:   

“This is an issue we feel strongly about and it is a published Moody’s criteria.  We are 
making an exception for this deal only.  … Going forward this has to be effective date 
level.  I would urge you to let your colleagues know as well since we will not be in a 
position to give in on this issue in future deals.”1087

  

 
         A similar scenario played out at S&P.  A Goldman Sachs banker strongly objected to a 
rating decision on a CDO called Abacus 2006-12:   
 

“I would add that this scenario is very different from an optional redemption as you point 
out below since the optional redemption is at Goldman’s option and a stated maturity is 
not.  We therefore cannot settle for the most conservative alternative as I believe you are 
suggesting.”  
 

The S&P director pushed back, saying that what Goldman wanted was “a significant departure 
from our current criteria,” but then suggested an exception could be made if it were limited to the 
CDO at hand and did not apply to future transactions:  
 

“As you point out, it is a conservative position for S&P to take, but it is one we’ve taken 
with all Dealers.  Since time is of the essence, this may be another issue that we table for 
2006-12 [the CDO under consideration], but would have to be addressed in future 
trades.”1088

  

But a Moody’s analyst showed how difficult it was to allow an exception once and 

 

demand different conduct in the future:   
 

“I am worried that we are not able to give these complicated deals the attention they 
really deserve, and that they [Credit Suisse] are taking advantage of the ‘light’ review and 
the growing sense of ‘precedent’. 
 
As for the precedential effects, we had indicated that some of the ‘fixes’ we agreed to in 
Qian’s deal were ‘for this deal only’….  When I asked Roland if they had given further 
thought to a more robust approach, he said (unsurprisingly) that they had no success and 
could we please accept the same [stopgap] measure for this deal.”1089

Linking a Rating to a Fee.  On at least one occasion, an investment bank seeking a 

credit rating attempted to link the ratings it would receive with the amount of fees it would pay.  
In June 2007, Merrill Lynch was seeking a rating from Moody’s for a CDO known as Belden 
Point.1090  Moody’s agreed to rate the CDO, but only for a higher than usual fee using a 
“complex CDO fee schedule.”1091  Merrill Lynch responded: “[N]o one here has ever heard or 
seen this fee structure applied for any deal in the past.  Could you point us to a precedent deal 
where we have approved this?”1092

  Moody’s replied: 

 
“[W]e do not view this transaction as a standard CDO transaction and the rating process 
so far has already shown that the analysis for this deal is far more involved and will 
continue to be so.  We have spent significant amount of resource[s] on this deal and it 
will be difficult for us to continue with this process if we do not have an agreement on the 
fee issue.”1093
 
The next day, Merrill Lynch wrote:  

 

“We are okay with the revised fee schedule for this transaction.  We are agreeing to this 
under the assumption that this will not be a precedent for any future deals and that you 
will work with us further on this transaction to try and get to some middle ground with 
respect to the ratings.”1094
 

 

 

Moody’s responded: 
 

 

“We agree that this will not be a precedent for future deals by default and we will discuss 
with you on a case by case basis if [the] Complex CDO rating application should be 
applied to future deals.  We will certainly continue working with you on this transaction, 
but analytical discussions/outcomes should be independent of any fee discussions.”1095
 
Vertical CDO.  A transaction known as Vertical ABS CDO 2007-1 helps illustrate how 

 
imbalanced the relationship between investment bankers and rating analysts became.  In 
connection with that CDO, an investment banker from UBS failed to cooperate with S&P rating 
analysts requesting information to analyze the transaction.  
 

On March 30, 2007, an S&P analyst wrote that UBS wanted to close the deal in ten days, 

but was not providing the information S&P needed: 
                                                                                                                                                             
exclude any mention of the one notch rule from the general communication?  Instead, we should give comm[ittee] 
chairs the discretion to apply the rule as they see fit.  In this way, there is less of a chance of it getting back to the 
bankers as a ‘general rule’.  They are more likely to know it as something that only applies, as a concession, on the 
deal that they are working on.”).

“Sarah and I have been working with James Yao from UBS but we have not been getting 
cooperation from him.  He has told me that I am jeopardizing the deal.  …  This is the 
third time that he refuses to model the cashflow according to the Indenture and 
Criteria.”1096
    

 

A few days later, in an April 5, 2007 instant message, one S&P analyst wrote:  “[W]hat 
happened? … [I] heard some fury.”  His colleague responded that it was Mr. Yao, the UBS 
banker.1097
 

  Later the same day, an S&P manager wrote that the three analysts:  

“[w]ould like to give us a heads-up with respect to the lack of responsiveness/cooperation 
from UBS … on Vertical 2007-1.  There seems to be a general lack of interest to work 
WITH us, incorporate our comments, or modeling to our criteria.  Based on their 
collective difficult experience so far, our analysts estimate a smooth closing is unlikely.  
(The behavior is not limited to this deal either.)” 1098
 

    

 
“Vertical is politically closely tied to B of A – and is mostly a marketing shop – helping 
to take risk off books of B o A.  Don’t see why we have to tolerate lack of cooperation.  
Deals likely not to perform.”1099

 

An S&P senior director responded: 

 

284 

 

Despite the uncooperative investment banker and prediction that the CDO was unlikely to 
perform, S&P analysts continued to work hard on the rating.  One of the analysts sent an email to 
her colleagues describing their efforts to get the CDO to pass tests for issuing investment grade 
ratings:   
 

“Just wanted to let you know that this deal is closing and going Effective next Tuesday, 
but our rated Equity tranche (BBB) is failing in our cashflow modeling.  
  
“Sarah tried a lot of ways to have the model passed. Unfortunately we are still failing by 
1bp [basis point], without any stress runs and without modeling certain fees (anticipated 
to be minimal).  
  
“In addition, we already incorporated the actual ramped up portfolio, and not a 
hypothetical one, for this exercise.”1100
  
After another day of work, the analyst reported she had found a “mistake” that, when 

  

corrected, would allow Vertical to get the desired investment grade credit ratings:

be addressed in some way.”1101
 

    

These emails show S&P analysts expending great effort to provide favorable ratings to the UBS 
CDO, despite concerns about its creditworthiness.1102

  
On April 10, 2007, just three months before the July 2007 mass downgrades of subprime 
RMBS, S&P issued ratings for the Vertical securitization.  All but one of the nine tranches were 
given investment grade ratings, with the top three receiving AAA.  Moody’s issued similar 
ratings.1103
 

Four months later in August 2007, all but the top three tranches were put on credit 

watch.1104   Two months after that, in October, Moody’s downgraded all but one of the Vertical 
securities to junk status.1105  In 2008, the CDO was liquidated.1106
  The chart below shows how 
the various tranches were originally rated by S&P, only to be downgraded to a D – the rating 
given to securities in default.

investment grade ratings to seven of the eight tranches it rated.  See 10/24/2007 email from Jonathan Polansky to 
Moody’s colleagues, Hearing Exhibit 4/23-94f.  S&P followed suit on November 14, 2007, downgrading all but two 
of Vertical’s tranches, with five falling to junk status.  11/14/2007 “112 Ratings Lowered on 21 U.S. Cash Flow,

One of the purchasers of Vertical securities, a hedge fund called Pursuit Partners, sued 
UBS, S&P, and Moody’s over the quick default.  Both credit rating agencies filed successful 
motions to be dismissed from the lawsuit, but the court ordered UBS to set aside $35 million for 
a possible award to the investor.  The investor had found internal UBS emails calling the 
investment grade Vertical securities “crap.”1107

 
Barring Analysts.  Rating analysts who insisted on obtaining detailed information about 
transactions sometimes became unpopular with investment bankers who pressured the analysts’ 
directors to have them barred from rating their deals.  One Moody’s analyst, Richard Michalek, 
testified before the Subcommittee that he was prohibited from working on RMBS transactions 
for several banks because he scrutinized deals too closely.  He stated:  
 

 

“During my tenure at Moody’s, I was explicitly told that I was ‘not welcome’ on deals 
structured by certain banks.  ...  I was told by my then-current managing director in 2001 
that I was ‘asked to be replaced’ on future deals by … CSFB [Credit Suisse First Boston], 
and then at Merrill Lynch. Years later, I was told by a different managing director that a 
CDO team leader at Goldman Sachs also asked, while praising the thoroughness of my 
work, that after four transactions he would prefer another lawyer be given an opportunity 
to work on his deals.”1108

   

   

At the Subcommittee’s April 23 hearing, Yuri Yoshizawa, the Senior Managing Director 

 
This analyst’s claim was corroborated by the Moody’s Managing Director who was his superior 
at the time.1109
 
 
of Moody’s Derivatives Group testified that the relationship between CDO analysts and 
investment banks “could get very contentious and very abusive.”1110  She testified that she did 
get complaints from investment banks who wanted analysts removed from conducting their 
ratings, because they were unhappy with those analysts.  She testified that “[t]here was always 
pressure from banks, including [removing analysts from transactions].”1111  She stated that she 
did, in fact, remove analysts from rating certain banks’ transactions, but claimed she did so to 
protect the analysts from abuse rather than to appease the complaining bank.1112
  When asked 
whether she ever protected her analysts by instead banning the abusive bank employee from 
Moody’s interactions, she could not recall taking that action.

Ratings Shopping.  It is not surprising that credit rating agencies at times gave into 

pressure from the investment banks and accorded them undue influence in the ratings process.  
The rating companies were directly dependent upon investment bankers to bring them business 
and were vulnerable to threats that the investment bankers would take their business elsewhere if 
they did not get the ratings they wanted.  Moody’s Chief Credit Officer told the Subcommittee 
staff that ratings shopping, the practice in which investment banks chose the credit rating agency 
offering the highest rating for a proposed transaction, was commonplace prior to 2008.1113

   

Ratings shopping inevitably weakens standards as each credit rating agency seeks to 

provide the most favorable rating to win business.  It is a conflict of interest problem that results 
in a race to the bottom – with every credit rating agency competing to produce credit ratings to 
please its paying clients.  Moody’s CEO described the problem this way:  “What happened in ’04 
and ’05 with respect to subordinated tranches is that our competition, Fitch and S&P, went nuts.  
Everything was investment grade.  It didn’t really matter.”1114

   

All of the witnesses who were questioned about ratings shopping during the 

Subcommittee’s hearing confirmed its existence: 

Senator Levin:  Ms. Yoshizawa [Senior Managing Director, Moody’s Derivatives 
Group], we were advised by Moody’s Chief Credit Officer that it was common 
knowledge that ratings shopping occurred in structured finance.  In other words, 
investment bankers sought ratings from credit rating agencies who would give them their 
highest ratings.  Would you agree with that? 

Ms. Yoshizawa:  I agree that credit shopping does exist, yes. 

 

Senator Levin:  Ms. Barnes [Managing Director, S&P RMBS Group], would you agree 
that the same thing existed in your area? 
 
Ms. Barnes:  Yes, Mr. Chairman.1115
 

 

Moody’s CEO, Ray McDaniel echoed this concern during the hearing: 
 

Senator Levin:  There are a lot of interesting things there that your Chief Credit Officer, 
Mr. Kimball, wrote in October of 2007 ….  One of the things he wrote, and this is under 
market share, he says in paragraph five, ‘Ideally, competition would be primarily on the 
basis of ratings quality’ – that is ideally – ‘with a second component of price and a third

participants.”

component of service.  Unfortunately, of the three competitive factors, rating quality is 
proving the least powerful.’  …  ‘It turns out that ratings quality has surprisingly few 
friends; issuers want high ratings; investors don’t want rating downgrades; short-sighted 
bankers labor short-sightedly to game the rating agencies for a few extra basis points on 
execution.’  Would you agree with that? 
 
Mr. McDaniel:  In this section, he is talking about the issue of rating shopping, and I 
agree that that existed then and exists now.1116

 

(3)  Inaccurate Models 

 

            The conflict of interest problem was not the only reason that Moody’s and S&P issued 
inaccurate RMBS and CDO credit ratings.  Another problem was that the credit rating models 
they used were flawed.  Over time, from 2004 to 2006, S&P and Moody’s revised their rating 
models, but never enough to produce accurate forecasts of the coming wave of mortgage 
delinquencies and defaults.  Key problems included inadequate performance data for the higher 
risk mortgages flooding the mortgage markets and inadequate correlation factors.   
 

In addition, the companies failed to provide their ratings personnel with clear, consistent, 

and comprehensive criteria to evaluate complex structured finance deals.  The absence of 
effective criteria was particularly problematic, because the ratings models did not conclusively 
determine the ratings for particular transactions.  Instead, modeling results could be altered by 
the subjective judgment of analysts and their supervisors.  This subjective factor, while 
unavoidable due to the complexity and novelty of the transactions being rated, rendered the 
process vulnerable to improper influence and inflated ratings.     

 
(a) Inadequate Data 
 
CRA analysts relied on their firm’s quantitative rating models to calculate the probable 
default and loss rates for particular pools of assets.  These models were handicapped, however, 
by a lack of relevant performance data for the high risk residential mortgages supporting most 
RMBS and CDO securities, by a lack of mortgage performance data in an era of stagnating or 
declining housing prices, by the credit rating agencies’ unwillingness to devote sufficient 
resources to update their models, and by the failure of the models to incorporate accurate 
correlation assumptions predicting how defaulting mortgages might affect other mortgages. 
 
Lack of High Risk Mortgage Performance Data.  The CRA models failed, in part, 
 
because they relied on historical data to predict how RMBS securities would behave, and the 
models did not use adequate performance data in the development of criteria to rate subprime 
and other high risk mortgages that proliferated in the housing market in the years leading up to 
the financial crisis.  From 2004 through 2007, many RMBS and CDO securities were comprised 
of residential mortgages that were not like those that had been modeled in the past.  As one S&P 
email observed: 
                                                 
1116 April 23, 2010 Subcommittee Hearing at 100-101. 

289 

 

“[T]he assumptions and the historical data used [in the models] … never included the 
performance of these types of residential mortgage loans  .… The data was gathered and 
computed during a time when loans with over 100% LTV or no stated income were 
rare.”1117
 

  

In contrast to decades of actual performance data for 30-year mortgages with fixed interest rates, 
the new subprime, high risk products had little to no track record to predict their rates of default.  
In fact, Moody’s RMBS rating model was not even used to rate subprime mortgages until 
December 2006; prior to that time, Moody’s used a system of “benchmarking” in which it rated a 
subprime mortgage pool by comparing it to other subprime pools Moody’s had already rated.1118
 

 Lack of Data During Era of Stagnant or Falling Home Prices.  In addition, the 
models operated with subprime data for mortgages that had not been exposed to stagnant or 
falling housing prices.  As one February 2007 presentation from a Deutsche Bank investment 
banker explained, the models used to calculate “subprime mortgage lending criteria and bond 
subordination levels are based largely on performance experience that was mostly accumulated 
since the mid-1990s, when the nation’s housing market has been booming.”1119  A former 
managing director in Moody’s Structured Finance Group put it this way:  “[I]t was ‘like 
observing 100 years of weather in Antarctica to forecast the weather in Hawaii.”1120
  In 
September 2007, after the crisis had begun, an S&P executive testified before Congress that: 

 

 

 

 

“[W]e are fully aware that, for all our reliance on our analysis of historically rooted data 
that sometimes went as far back as the Great Depression, some of that data has proved no 
longer to be as useful or reliable as it has historically been.”1121

   

 

The absence of relevant data for use in RMBS modeling left the credit rating agencies 

 
unable to accurately predict mortgage default and loss rates when housing prices stopped 
climbing.  The absence of relevant performance data for high risk mortgage products in an era of 
stagnant or declining housing prices impacted the rating of not only RMBS transactions, but also 
CDOs, which typically included RMBS securities and relied heavily on RMBS credit ratings. 

Lack of Investment.  One reason that Moody’s and S&P lacked relevant loan 

performance data for their RMBS models was not simply that the data was difficult to obtain, but

that both companies were reluctant to devote the resources needed to improve their modeling, 
despite soaring revenues.   
 
 
Moody’s senior managers even expressed skepticism about whether new loan data was 
needed and, in fact, generally did not purchase new loan data for a four-year period, from 2002 
to 2006.1122
  In a 2000 internal email exchange, the head of Moody’s Structured Finance Group 
at the time, Brian Clarkson, wrote the following regarding the purchasing of data for Moody’s 
RMBS model: 
 

“I have a wild thought also – let[’]s not even consider BUYING anymore data, programs, 
software or companies until we figure out what we have and what we intend to do with 
what we have.  From what I have heard and read so far we have approaches (MBS, 
Tranching and Spread) few use or understand (let alone being able to explain it to the 
outside) and new data that we are unable to use.  We want more data when most of the 
time we rate MBS deals using arbitrary rule of thumb?!! … 

 

“I suggest we spend less time asking for more data and software (I have not seen 
anything that sets forth the gains in revenue from such spending -- it is easy to ask for $$ 
-- much harder to justify it against competing projects) and more time figuring out how to 
utilize what we have by way of good analysis, a solid approach to this market a proper 
staffing model.”1123
 

 

In response to Brian Clarkson’s email, a managing director wrote: 

 
“As you know, I don’t think we need to spend a lot of $ or resources to improve the 
model from an analytic perspective; but I’d need to defer to people more in the loop 
(looks like you’re that person) on whether the marketing component mandates some 
announcement of model and data improvement. … 
 
Make sure you talk to Noel and maybe Fons about the decision to buy the data; I was 
invited to the original meeting so that the powers that be (at the time) could understand 
the data originally used.  I felt that the arguments for buying the data and re-inventing the 
model were not persuasive .… The most convincing argument for buying the data was 
that it would be a cornerstone for marketing, that S&P touted the size of their database as 
a competitive advantage and that this was why they had the market share advantage.”1124
 
 
Moody’s advised the Subcommittee that, in fact, it generally did not obtain any new loan 

data for its RMBS model development for four years, from 2002 until 2006, although it 
continued to improve its RMBS model in other ways.1125

  In 2005, a Moody’s employee survey

information on any new data it had received or purchased for its models from 2002 to 2007.

found that the company’s employees felt that Moody’s should have been spending more 
resources on improving its models.1126  In 2006, Moody’s obtained new loan level data for use in 
its new subprime model, M3 Subprime.1127

 
In contrast to Moody’s, S&P did purchase new loan data on several occasions from 2002 
to 2006, but told the Subcommittee that this data did not provide meaningful results that could be 
used in its RMBS model prior to 2006.1128  In 2002, for example, S&P said that it purchased data 
on approximately 640,000 loans, including ARM and hybrid loans.  S&P told the Subcommittee 
that it developed an equation from that data set which predicted a lower default rate for ARM 
and hybrid loans than for fixed rate loans.  S&P considered this counter-intuitive and chose not 
to incorporate it into its model.1129  In 2005, S&P purchased data on another 2.9 million loans 
that included first and second liens for prime, subprime, Alt A, high LTV, and home equity 
loans.1130  S&P claimed that it made “concerted efforts to analyze” this data, “both by employing 
external consultants and dedicating resources within Standard & Poor’s to analyze the data for 
criteria development.”1131

   

 
Contrary to S&P’s claim, the former head of the S&P RMBS Ratings Group, Frank 

Raiter, who worked at S&P until 2005, told the Subcommittee that management did not provide 
him with sufficient resources to analyze the data and develop improved criteria for the RMBS 
model.1132  Mr. Raiter told the Subcommittee that he personally informed S&P’s senior 
management about the need to update S&P’s model with better loan data several years before the 
crisis.1133  Mr. Raiter also testified that the “analysts at S&P had developed better methods for 
determining default which did capture some of the variations among products that were to 
become evident at the advent of the crisis,”1134 but those methods were not incorporated into the 
RMBS model before he left in 2005.   Mr. Raiter said that “[i]t is my opinion that had these 
models been implemented we would have had an earlier warning about the performance of many 
of the new products that subsequently lead [sic] to such substantial losses.”1135

According to Mr. Raiter, even though S&P revenues had increased dramatically and were 

generated in large part by the RMBS Group, senior management had no interest in committing 
the resources needed to update the RMBS model with improved criteria from the new loan data.  
Mr. Raiter said that S&P did not spend sufficient money on better analytics, because S&P 
already dominated the RMBS ratings market:  “[T]he RMBS group enjoyed the largest ratings 
market share among the three major rating agencies (often 92% or better), and improving the 
model would not add to S&P’s revenues.”1136
 

Poor Correlation Risk Assumptions.  In addition to using inadequate loan performance 
data, the S&P and Moody’s credit rating models also incorporated inadequate assumptions about 
the correlative risk of mortgage backed securities.  Correlative risk measures the likelihood of 
multiple negative events happening simultaneously, such as the likelihood of RMBS assets 
defaulting together.  It examines the likelihood, for example, that two houses in the same 
neighborhood will default together compared to two houses in different states.  If the 
neighborhood houses are more likely to default together, they would have a higher correlation 
risk than the houses in different states. 
 

 

The former head of S&P’s Global CDO Group, Richard Gugliada, told the Subcommittee 

that the inaccurate RMBS and CDO ratings issued by his company were due, in part, to wrong 
assumptions in the S&P models about correlative risk.1137  Mr. Gugliada explained that, because 
CDOs held fewer assets than RMBS, statistical analysis was less helpful, and the modeling 
instead required use of significant performance assumptions, including on correlative risk.  He 
explained that the primary S&P CDO model, the “CDO Evaluator,” ran 100,000 simulations to 
determine how a pool would perform.  These simulations ran on a set of assumptions that took 
the place of historical performance data, according to Mr. Gugliada, and included assumptions 
on the probability of default and the correlation between assets if one or more assets began to 
default.  He said that S&P believed that RMBS assets were more likely to default together than, 
for example, corporate bonds held in a CDO.  He said that S&P had set the probability of 
corporate correlated defaults at 30 out of 100, and set the probability of RMBS correlated 
defaults at 40 out of 100.  He said that the financial crisis has now shown that the RMBS 
correlative assumptions were far too low and should have been set closer to 80 or 90 out of 
100.1138
 

 

On one occasion in 2006, an outside party also highlighted a problem with the S&P 
model’s consideration of correlative risk.  On March 20, 2006, a senior managing director at 
Aladdin Capital Management, LLC sent an email to S&P expressing concern about a later 
version of its CDO model, Evaluator 3:   

 
“Thanks for a terrific presentation at the UBS conference.  I mentioned to you a possible 
error in the new Evaluator 3.0 assumptions:

Two companies in the same Region belonging to two different local Sectors are assumed 
to be correlated (by 5%), while if they belong to the same local Sector then they are 
uncorrelated. 
 
I think you probably didn’t mean that.”1139

 

 
Apparently, this problem with the model had already been identified within S&P.  Two S&P 
employees discussed the problem on the same email, with one saying:  
 

“I have already brought this issue up and it was decided that it would be changed in the 
future, the next time we update the criteria. … [T]he correlation matrix is inconsistent.”   
 

Despite this clear problem resulting in the understatement of correlative risk for assets in the 
same region, S&P in this instance did not immediately take the steps needed to repair its CDO 
model. 
 

At Moody’s, a former Managing Director of the CDO Group, Gary Witt, observed a 

different set of correlation problems with Moody’s CDO model.  Mr. Witt, who was responsible 
for managing Moody’s CDO analysts as well as its CDO modeling, told the Subcommittee that 
he had become uncomfortable with the lack of correlation built into the company’s 
methodology.1140
Expansion Technique (BET),” addressed correlation by having a diversity score at a time when 
CDOs had diverse assets such as credit cards or aircraft lease revenues, in addition to RMBS 
securities.  By 2004, however, Mr. Witt said that most CDOs contained primarily RMBS assets, 
lacked diversity, and made little use of the diversity score. 

  According to Mr. Witt, Moody’s model, which then used the “Binomial 

 

Mr. Witt told the Subcommittee that, from 2004 to 2005, he worked on modifying the 

BET model to improve its consideration of correlation factors.  According to Mr. Witt, modeling 
changes like the one he worked on had to be done on an employee’s own time – late nights and 
weekends – because there was no time during the work week due to the volume of deals.  Indeed, 
during his eighteen month tenure as a Managing Director in the CDO Group, Mr. Witt “spent a 
huge amount of time working on methodology because the ABS CDO market especially was in 
transition from multi-sector to single sector transactions [RMBS]” which he felt necessitated an 
update of Moody’s model.1141  Mr. Witt indicated that, in June 2005, Moody’s CDO model was 
changed to incorporate part of his suggested improvements, but did not go as far as he had 
proposed.  When asked about this 2005 decision, Mr. Witt indicated that he did not feel that 
Moody’s was getting the ratings wrong for CDOs with RMBS assets, but he did “think that we 
[Moody’s] were not allocating nearly enough resources to get the ratings right.”1142

The lack of performance data for high risk residential mortgage products, the lack of 
mortgage performance data in an era of stagnating or declining housing prices, the failure to 
expend resources to improve their model analytics, and incorrect correlation assumptions meant 
that the RMBS and CDO models used by Moody’s and S&P were out of date, technically 
deficient, and could not provide accurate default and loss predictions to support the credit ratings 
being issued.  Yet Moody’s and S&P analysts told the Subcommittee that their analysts relied 
heavily on their model outputs to project the default and loss rates for RMBS and CDO pools 
and rate RMBS and CDO securities.  
 

(b)  Unclear and Subjective Ratings Process 
Obtaining expected default and loss analysis from the Moody’s and S&P credit rating 

 
models was only one aspect of the work performed by RMBS and CDO analysts.  Equally 
important was their effort to analyze a proposed transaction’s legal structure, cash flow, 
allocation of revenues, the size and nature of its tranches, and its credit enhancements.  
Analyzing each of these elements involved often complex judgments about how a transaction 
would work and what impact various factors would have on credit risk.  Although both Moody’s 
and S&P published a number of criteria, methodologies, and guidance on how to handle a variety 
of credit risk factors, the novelty and complexity of the RMBS and CDO transactions, the 
volume and speed of the ratings process, and inconsistent applications of the various rules, meant 
that CRA analysts were continuously faced with issues that were difficult to resolve about how 
to analyze a transaction and apply the company’s standards.  Evidence obtained by the 
Subcommittee indicates that, at times, ratings personnel acted with limited guidance, unclear 
criteria, and a limited understanding of the complex deals they were asked to rate.   

Many documents obtained by the Subcommittee disclosed confusion and a high level of 

frustration from RMBS and CDO analysts about how to handle ratings issues and how the 
ratings process actually worked.  In May 2007, for example, one S&P employee wrote:  “[N]o 
body gives a straight answer about anything around here …. [H]ow about we come out with new 
[criteria] or a new stress and ac[tu]ally have clear cut parameters on what the hell we are 
supposed to do.”1143
decision wrote:

“Chui told me that while the three of us voted ‘no’, in writing, that there were 4 other 
‘yes’ votes.  … [T]his is a great example of how the criteria process is NOT supposed to 
work.  Being out-voted is one thing (and a good thing, in my view), but being out-voted 
by mystery voters with no ‘logic trail’ to refer to is another.  ...  Again, this is exactly the 
kind of backroom decision-making that leads to inconsistent criteria, confused analysts, 
and pissed-off clients.”1144

When asked by the SEC to compile a list of its rating criteria in 2007, S&P was unable to 

 
identify all of its criteria for making rating decisions.  The head of criteria for the structured 
finance department, for example, who was tasked with gathering information for the SEC, wrote 
in an email to colleagues: 
 

“[O]ur published criteria as it currently stands is a bit too unwieldy and all over the map 
in terms of being current or comprehensive.  ... [O]ur SF [Structured Finance] rating 
approach is inherently flexible and subjective, while much of our written criteria is 
detailed and prescriptive.  Doing a complete inventory of our criteria and documenting all 
of the areas where it is out of date or inaccurate would appear to be a huge job ....”1145
 
The confused and subjective state of S&P criteria, including when the criteria had to be 

 
applied, is also evident in a May 2007 email sent by an S&P senior director to colleagues 
discussing whether to apply a default stress test to certain CDOs:   
 

  

“[T]he cash-flow criteria from 2004 (see below), actually states [using a default stress test 
when additional concerns about the CDO are raised] ... in the usual vague S&P’s way .... 
Still, consistency is key for me and if we decide we do not need that, fine but I would 
recommend we do something.  Unless we have too many deals in [the] US where this 
could hurt.”1146

   

 

 

Moody’s ratings criteria were equally subjective, changeable, and inconsistent.  In an 

October 2007 internal email, for example, Moody’s Chief Risk Officer wrote:   

“Methodologies & criteria are published and thus put boundaries on rating committee 
discretion.  (However, there is usually plenty of latitude within those boundaries to 
register market influence.)”1147

   

Another factor was that ratings analysts were also under constant pressure to quickly 

 
 
analyze and rate complex RMBS and CDO transactions.  To enable RMBS or CDO transactions 
to meet projected closing dates, it was not uncommon, as shown above, for CRA analysts to 
grant exceptions to established methodologies and criteria, put off analysis of complex issues to 
later transactions, and create precedents that investment banks invoked in subsequent 
                                                                                                                                                             
gone effective already, it was surveillance’s responsibility, and I never heard about it again.  Anyway, because of 
that, I never created a new monitor.”).

securitizations.  CRA analysts were then compelled to decide whether to follow an earlier 
exception, revert to the published methodology and criteria, or devise still another compromise.  
The result was additional confusion over how to rate complex RMBS and CDO securities.  
 
 
Publication of the CRAs’ ratings methodologies and criteria was also inconsistent.  
According to an October 2006 email sent by an investment banker at Morgan Stanley to an 
analyst at Moody’s, for example, key methodology changes had not been made public:  “Our 
problem here is that nobody has told us about the changes that we are later expected to adhere to.  
Since there is no published criteria outlining the change in methodology how are we supposed to 
find out about it?”1148  On another occasion, a Moody’s analyst sought guidance from senior 
managers because of the lack of consistency in applying certain criteria.  He wrote:  “Over time, 
different chairs have been giving different guidelines at different point[s] of time on how much 
over-enhancement we need for a bond to be notched up to Aaa.”1149  In a November 2007 email, 
another senior executive described the criteria problem this way:  “It seems, though, that the 
more of the ad hoc rules we add, the further away from the data and models we move and the 
closer we move to building models that ape analysts expectations, no?”1150
 

The rating agency models were called by some a “black box,” because they were difficult 
to understand and not always predictable.  Issuers and investors alike vented frustrations toward 
the black box and basing decisions on a computer program few understood or could replicate.  
This email from June 20, 2006, recounts the conversation one Moody’s employee had with 
another over frustrations they had heard from an outside issuer. 
 

   

“Managers are tired of large ‘grids.’ They would rather prefer a model based test like 
what S&P and Fitch do.  Pascale disagrees with these managers.  As a wrapper, she hates 
that the credit quality of what she wraps is linked to a black box. Also, she hates the fact 
that the black box can change from time to time.”1151

 

A January 2007 email from BlackRock to S&P (and other rating agencies) also complained 
about the “black box” problem: 
 

“What steps are you taking to better communicate and comfort investors about your 
ratings process?  In other w[o]rds, how do we break the ‘black box’ that determines 
enhancement levels?”1152

At times, some CRA analysts openly questioned their ability to rate some complex 

securities.  In a December 2006 email chain regarding a synthetic CDO squared, for example, 
S&P analysts appeared challenged by a modeling problem and questioned their ability to rate the 
product.  One analyst wrote:  “Rating agencies continue to create and [sic] even bigger monster –  
the CDO market.  Let’s hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards 
falters.”1153  In an email written in a similar vein, an S&P manager preparing for a presentation 
wrote to her colleagues:  “Can anyone give me a crash course on the ‘hidden risks in CDO’s of 
RMBS’?”1154  In an April 2007 instant message, an S&P analyst offered this cynical comment:  
“[W]e rate every deal[.]  [I]t could be structured by cows and we would rate it.”1155

   

 

(4)  Failure to Retest After Model Changes 
Another key factor that contributed to inaccurate credit ratings was the failure of 

Moody’s and S&P to retest outstanding RMBS and CDO securities after improvements were 
made to their credit rating models.  These model improvements generally did not derive from 
data on new types of high risk mortgages, but were intended to improve the models’ predictive 
capability,1156
 but even after they were made, CRA analysts failed to utilize them to downgrade 
artificially high RMBS and CDO credit ratings.    

 
Key model adjustments were made in 2006 to both the RMBS and CDO models to 

improve their ability to predict expected default and loss rates for higher risk mortgages.  Both 
Moody’s and S&P decided to apply the revised models to rate new RMBS and CDO 
transactions, but not to retest outstanding subprime RMBS and CDO securities, even though 
many of those securities contained the same types of mortgages and risks that the models were 
recalibrated to evaluate.  Had they retested the existing RMBS and CDO securities and issued 
appropriate rating downgrades starting in 2006, the CRAs could have signaled investors about 
the increasing risk in the mortgage market, possibly dampened the rate of securitizations, and 
possibly reduced the impact of the financial crisis. 
 
 
conduct ongoing surveillance of the RMBS and CDO securities they rated to ensure the ratings 
remained valid over the life of the rated securities.  In fact, both companies charged annual 
surveillance fees to the issuers of the securities to pay for the surveillance costs, and each had 
established a separate division to carry out surveillance duties.  Due to the huge numbers of 
RMBS and CDO securities issued in the years leading up to the financial crisis, those 
surveillance divisions were responsible for reviewing tens of thousands of securities.  The issue 
of whether to retest the outstanding securities using the revised credit rating models was, thus, a 
significant issue affecting numerous securities and substantial company resources. 
 

Surveillance Obligations.  Both Moody’s and S&P were obligated by contract to

1155 4/5/2007 instant message exchange between Shannon Mooney and Rahul Dilip Shah, Hearing Exhibit 4/23-30a. 
1156 These model improvements still significantly underestimated subprime risk as is evidenced by the sheer number 
of downgrades that occurred after the model improvements for securities issued in 2006 and 2007.  

298 

 

Increased Loss Protection.  In July 2006, S&P made significant adjustments to its 
subprime RMBS model.  S&P had determined that, to avoid an increasing risk of default, 
subprime RMBS securities required additional credit enhancements that would provide 40% 
more protection to keep the investment grade securities from experiencing losses.1157
  Moody’s 
made similar adjustments to its RMBS model around the same time, settling on parameters that 
required 30% more loss protection.  As Moody’s explained to the Senate Banking Committee in 
September 2007: 
 

“In response to the increase in the riskiness of loans made during the last few years and 
the changing economic environment, Moody’s steadily increased its loss expectations 
and subsequent levels of credit protection on pools of subprime loans.  Our loss 
expectations and enhancement levels rose by about 30% over the 2003 to 2006 time 
period, and as a result, bonds issued in 2006 and rated by Moody’s had more credit 
protection than bonds issued in earlier years.”1158
 
The determination that RMBS pools required 30-40% more credit enhancements to 

   

protect higher rated tranches from loss reflected calculations by the updated CRA models that 
these asset pools were exposed to significantly more risk of delinquencies and defaults.  
Requiring increased loss protection meant that Moody’s and S&P analysts had to require more 
revenues to be set aside in each pool to provide AAA ratings greater protection than before the 
model adjustments.  Requiring increased loss protection also meant RMBS pools would have a 
smaller pool of AAA securities to sell to investors.  That meant, in turn, that RMBS pools would 
produce fewer profits for issuers and arrangers.  Requiring increased loss protection had a similar 
impact on CDOs that included RMBS assets.    
 

Retesting RMBS Securities.  Even though S&P and Moody’s had independently revised 

their RMBS models and, by 2006, determined that additional credit enhancements of 30-40% 
were needed to protect investment grade tranches from loss, in 2006 and the first half of 2007, 
neither company used its revised models to evaluate existing rated subprime RMBS securities as 
part of its surveillance efforts.1159
announcing that no retests would be done: 

  Instead S&P, for example, sent out a June 2006 email

“Simply put – although the RMBS Group does not ‘grandfather’ existing deals, there is 
not an absolute and direct link between changes to our new ratings models and 
subsequent rating actions taken by the RMBS Surveillance Group.  As a result, there will 
not be wholesale rating actions taken in July or shortly thereafter on outstanding RMBS 
transactions, absent a deterioration in performance and projected credit support on any 
individual transaction.”1160
 
Moody’s and S&P each advised the Subcommittee that it had decided not to retest any 

  

existing rated RMBS securities, because it felt that actual performance data for the pools in 
question would provide a better indicator of future defaults and loss than application of its 
statistical model.  But actual loan performance data for the subprime mortgages in the pools – the 
fact that, for example, timely loan payments had been made in the past on most of those loans – 
provided an incomplete picture regarding whether those payments would continue to be made 
after home prices stopped climbing, refinancings became difficult, and higher interest rates took 
effect in many of the mortgages.  By focusing only on actual past performance, the ratings 
ignored foreseeable problems and gave investors false assurances about the creditworthiness of 
the RMBS and CDO securities.   
 

Some CRA employees expressed concern about the limitations placed on their ability to 

alter ratings to reflect expected performance of the rated securities.  In a July 2007 email just 
before the mass ratings downgrades began, for example, an S&P senior executive raised 
concerns about these to the head of the RMBS Surveillance Group as follows: 

 
“Overall, our ratings should be based on our expectations of performance, not 
solely the month to month performance record, which will only be backward 
looking. ... Up to this point, Surveillance has been ‘limited’ in when we can 
downgrade a rating (only after it has experienced realized losses), how far we can 
adjust the rating (no more than 3 notches at a time is preferred), and how high up 
the capital structure we can go (not downgrading higher rated classes, if they 
‘pass’ our stressed cash flow runs).”1161
 

 

 In addition, many of the RMBS loans were less than a year old, making any performance 
data less significant and difficult to analyze.  In others words, the loans were too 
unseasoned or new to offer any real predictive performance value.   
 

                                                 
1160 6/23/2006 email from Thomas Warrack to Pat Jordan and Rosario Buendia, Hearing Exhibit 4/23-72 [emphasis

Committee:  “At S&P, there was an ongoing, often heated discussion that using the ratings model in surveillance 
would allow for re-rating every deal monthly and provide significantly improved measures of current and future 
performance.”  Prepared statement of Frank L. Raiter, “Credit Rating Agencies and the Financial Crisis,” before the

[emphasis in original].  

 
Some internal S&P emails suggest alternative explanations for the decision not to retest.  
In October 2005, for example, an S&P analytic manager in the Structured Finance Ratings Group 
sent an email to his colleagues asking:  “How do we handle existing deals especially if there are 
material changes [to a model] that can cause existing ratings to change?”  His email then laid out 
what he believed was S&P’s position at that time:   

 

• 

“I think the history has been to only re-review a deal under new assumptions/criteria 
when the deal is flagged for some performance reason.  I do not know of a situation 
where there were wholesale changes to existing ratings when the primary group 
changed assumptions or even instituted new criteria.  The two major reasons why we 
have taken the approach is (i) lack of sufficient personnel resources and (ii) not 
having the same models/information available for surveillance to relook at an existing 
deal with the new assumptions (i.e. no cash flow models for a number of assets).  The 
third reason is concerns of how disruptive wholesale rating changes, based on a 
criteria change, can be to the market. 

 
•   CDO is current[ly] debating the issue and appropriate approach as they change the 

300 

 

methodology.”1162

 

 

This email suggests the reason retesting did not occur was, not because S&P thought 
actual performance data would produce more accurate ratings for existing pools, but because 
S&P did not have the resources to retest, and lower ratings on existing deals might have 
disrupted the marketplace, upsetting investment banks and investors.  Several S&P managers and 
analysts confirmed in Subcommittee interviews that these were the real reasons for the decision 
not to retest existing RMBS securities.1163  Moody’s documents also suggest that resource 
constraints may lay behind its decision not to retest.1164
 
 
rushed to have deals rated before the CRAs implemented more stringent revised models.  In an 
attempt to explain why one RMBS security from the same vintage and originator was pricing 
better than another, a CDO trader wrote: 
 

The Subcommittee also found evidence suggesting that investment banks may have 

   

“Only reasons I can think for my guys showing you a tighter level is that we are very 
short this one and that the June 06 deals have a taint that earlier months don[’]t due to the 
theory that late June deals were crammed with bad stuff in order to beat the S & P 
[model] revisions.1165

Retesting CDO Securities.  The debate over retesting existing CDO securities followed 
 
a similar path to the debate over retesting RMBS securities.  The CDO Group at S&P first faced 
the retest question in the summer of 2005, when it made a major change to its CDO model, then 
Evaluator 3 (E3).1166  The S&P CDO Group appeared ready to announce and implement the 
improved model that summer, but then took more than a year to implement it as the group 
struggled to rationalize why it would not retest existing CDO securities with the improved 
assumptions.1167
  Internal S&P emails indicate that the primary considerations were, again, 
resource limitations and possible disruption to the CDO market, rather than concerns over 
accuracy.  For instance, in a June 2005 email sent to an S&P senior executive, the head of the 
CDO Group wrote:  

“The overarching issue at this point is what to do with currently rated transactions if we 
do release a new version of Evaluator.  Some of [us] believe for both logistical and 
market reasons that the existing deals should mainly be ‘grand fathered’.  Others believe 
that we should run all deals using the new Evaluator.  The problem with running all deals 
using E3 is twofold:  we don’t have the model or resource capacity to do so, nor do we all 
believe that even if we did have the capability, it would be the responsible thing to do to 
the market.”1168

 

 

 

 

Several months later the S&P CDO Ratings Group was still deliberating the issue.  In 

November 2005, an investment banker at Morgan Stanley who had concerns about whether E3 
would be used to retest existing deals and those in the pipeline expressed frustration at the delay:  
 

“We are in a bit of a pickle here.  My legal staff is not letting me send anything out to any 
investor on anything with an S&P rating right now. We are waiting for you to tell us … 
that you approve the disclaimer or are grandfathering [not retesting with E3] our existing 
and pipeline deals.  My business is on ‘pause’ right now.”1169

 

 
One S&P senior manager, frustrated by an inability to get an answer on the retesting issue, sent 
an email to a colleague complaining:  “Lord help our f**king scam ... this has to be the stupidest 
place I have worked at.”1170

 

                                                 
1166 The CDO models were simulation models dependent upon past credit ratings for the assets they included plus 
various performance and correlation assumptions.  See earlier discussion of these models.

In May 2006, S&P circulated a draft policy setting up what seemed to be an informal 

 
screening process “prior to transition date” to see how existing CDOs would be affected by the 
revised CDO model.  The draft offered a convoluted approach in an apparent attempt to avoid 
retesting all existing CDOs, which included allowing the use of the prior “E2” model and review 
“by a special E3 committee.”  The draft policy read in part as follows: 

 

“***PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL - S&P DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY*** 
Prior to Transition Date (in preparation for final implementation of E3 for cash 
CDOs): 

•  A large majority of the pre- E3 cash flow CDOs will be run through E3 in batch 

processes to see how the ratings look within the new model … 

• 

• 

• 

 Ratings falling more than 3 notches +/- from the current tranche rating in the 
batch process will be reviewed in detail for any modeling, data, performance or 
other issues 

 If any transactions are found to be passing/failing E3 by more than 3 notches due 
to performance reasons they will be handled through the regular surveillance 
process to see if the ratings are stable under current criteria (i.e., if they pass 
E2.4.3 using current cash flow assumptions the ratings will remain unchanged) 

 If any transactions are found to be passing/failing E3 by more than 3 notches due 
to a model gap between E2.4.3 and E3, they will be reviewed by a special E3 
committee ....”1171

 

Questions continued to be raised internally at S&P about the retesting issue.  In March 

It is unclear whether this screening actually took place. 
 
 
2007, almost a year after the change was made in the CDO model, an S&P senior executive 
wrote to the Chief Criteria Officer in the structured finance department:   
 

“Why did the criteria change made in mid 2006 not impact any outstanding transactions 
at the time we changed it, especially given the magnitude of the change we are 
highlighting in the article?  Should we apply the new criteria now, given what we now 
know?  If we did, what would be the impact?”1172
 

   

  But by then, residential mortgages were already defaulting in 

In July 2007, the same senior executive raised the issue again in an email asking the S&P 
Analytic Policy Board to address the alignment of surveillance methodology and new model 
changes at a “special meeting.”1173

Consequences for Investors.  During the April 23 Subcommittee hearing, credit ratings 
expert, Professor Arturo Cifuentes, explained to the Subcommittee the importance of retesting 
existing rated deals when there is a model change. 

Senator Levin:  If a ratings model changes its assumptions or criteria, for instance, if it 
becomes materially more conservative, how important is it that the credit rating agency 
use the new assumptions or criteria to re-test or re-evaluate securities that are under 
surveillance? 

Mr. Cifuentes:  Well, it is very important for two reasons:  Because if you do not do that, 
you are basically creating two classes of securities, a low class and an upper class, and 
that creates a discrepancy in the market.  At the same time, you are not being fair because 
you are giving an inflated rating then to a security or you are not communicating to the 
market that the ratings given before were of a different class.1174

 

 

 

 

 

Moody’s and S&P updated their RMBS and CDO models with more conservative criteria 

in 2006, but then used the revised models to evaluate only new RMBS and CDO transactions, 
bypassing the existing RMBS and CDO securities that could have benefited from the new credit 
analysis.  Even with respect to the new RMBS and CDOs, investment banks sought to delay use 
of the revised models that required additional credit enhancements to protect investment grade 
tranches from loss.  For example, in May 2007, Morgan Stanley sent an email to a Moody’s 
Managing Director with the following: 
 

“Thanks again for your help (and Mark’s) in getting Morgan Stanley up-to-speed with 
your new methodology.  As we discussed last Friday, please find below a list of 
transactions with which Morgan Stanley is significantly engaged already (assets in 
warehouses, some liabilities placed).  We appreciate your willingness to grandfather 
these transactions [under] Moody’s old methodology.”1175

   

When asked about the failure of Moody’s and S&P to retest existing securities after their 

model updates in 2006, the global head trader for CDOs from Deutsche Bank told the 
Subcommittee that he believed the credit rating agencies did not retest them, because to do so 
would have meant significant downgrades and “they did not want to upset the apple cart.”1176
  
Instead, the credit rating agencies waited until 2007, when the high risk mortgages underlying 
the outstanding RMBS and CDO securities incurred record delinquencies and defaults and then, 
based upon the actual loan performance, instituted mass ratings downgrades.  Those sudden mass 
downgrades caught many financial institutions and other investors by surprise, leaving them with

billions of dollars of suddenly unmarketable securities.  The RMBS secondary market collapsed 
soon after, and the CDO secondary market followed. 
 

(5)  Inadequate Resources 
In addition to operating with conflicts of interest, models containing inadequate 

 

 

performance data, subjective and inconsistent rating criteria, and a policy against using improved 
models to retest outstanding RMBS and CDO securities, and despite the increasing numbers of 
ratings issued each year and record revenues as a result, neither Moody’s nor S&P hired 
sufficient staff or devoted sufficient resources to ensure that the initial rating process and the 
subsequent surveillance process produced accurate credit ratings.   

Instead, both Moody’s and S&P forced their staffs to churn out new ratings and conduct 

required surveillance with limited resources.  Over time, the credit rating agencies’ profits 
became increasingly connected to issuing a high volume of ratings.  By not devoting sufficient 
resources to handle the high volume of ratings, the strain on resources negatively impacted the 
quality of the ratings and their surveillance.  
 

High Speed Ratings.  From 2000 to 2007, Moody’s and S&P issued record numbers of 

RMBS and CDO ratings.  Each year the number of ratings issued by each firm increased.  
According to SEC examinations of the firms, from 2002 to 2006, “the volume of RMBS deals 
rated by Moody’s increased by 137%, and the number of CDO deals … increased by 700%.”1177  
At S&P, the SEC determined that over the same time period, “the volume of RMBS deals rated 
by S&P increased by 130%, and the number of CDO deals … increased by over 900%.”1178
   In 
addition to the rapid growth in numbers, the transactions themselves grew in complexity, 
requiring more time and talent to analyze. 

   

The former head of the S&P RMBS Group, Frank Raiter, described the tension between 

profits and resources this way:  “Management wanted increased revenues and profit while 
analysts wanted more staff, data and IT support which increased expenses and obviously reduced 
profit.”1179

 
Moody’s CEO, Ray McDaniel, readily acknowledged during the Subcommittee’s April 

 
23 hearing that resources were stressed and that Moody’s was short staffed.1180
  He testified:  
“People were working longer hours than we wanted them to, working more days of the week 
than we wanted them to.”  He continued: “It was not for lack of having open positions, but with

the pace at which the market was growing, it was difficult to fill positions as quickly as we 
would have liked.”1181
 
 
Moody’s staff, however, had raised concerns about personnel shortages impacting their 
work quality as early as 2002.   A 2002 survey of the Structured Finance Group staff reported, 
for example: 
 

“[T]here is some concern about workload and its impact on operating effectiveness.   …  
Most acknowledge that Moody’s intends to run lean, but there is some question of 
whether effectiveness is compromised by the current deployment of staff.”1182
 

  

Similar concerns were expressed three years later in a 2005 employee survey:  
 

“We are over worked. Too many demands are placed on us for admin[istrative] tasks ... 
and are detracting from primary workflow .... We need better technology to meet the 
demand of running increasingly sophisticated models.”1183
 

 

In 2006, Moody’s analyst Richard Michalek worried that investment bankers were taking 
advantage of the fact that analysts did not have the time to understand complex deals.  He wrote: 

 
“I am worried that we are not able to give these complicated deals the attention they 
really deserve, and that they (CS) [Credit Suisse] are taking advantage of the ‘light’ 
review and the growing sense of ‘precedent’.”1184
 
Moody’s managers and analysts interviewed by the Subcommittee stated that staff 

 
shortages impacted how much time could be spent analyzing a transaction.  One analyst 
responsible for rating CDOs told the Subcommittee that, during the height of the boom, Moody’s 
analysts didn’t have time to understand the complex deals being rated and had to set priorities on 
what issues would be examined: 
 

 

“When I joined the [CDO] Group in 1999 there were seven lawyers and the Group rated 
something on the order of 40 – 60 transactions annually.  In 2006, the Group rated over 
600 transactions, using the resources of approximately 12 lawyers.  The hyper-growth 
years from the second half of 2004 through 2006 represented a steady and constant 
adjustment to the amount of time that could be allotted to any particular deal’s analysis, 
and with that adjustment, a constant re-ordering of the priority assigned to the issues to be 
raised at rating Committees.”1185

A Moody’s managing director responsible for supervising CDO analysts put it this way in a 2007 
email:  “Unfortunately, our analysts are o[v]erwhelmed .…”1186  Moody’s CEO testified at the 
Subcommittee’s hearing, “[w]e had stress on our resources in this period, absolutely.”1187   
Senator Levin asked him if Moody’s was profitable at the time, and he responded, “[w]e were 
profitable, yes.”1188
 
 
S&P also experienced significant resource shortages.  In 2004, for example, a managing 
director in the RMBS Group wrote a lengthy email about the resource problems impacting credit 
analysis: 
 

 

“I am trying to put my hat on not only for ABS/RMBS but for the department and be 
helpful but feel that it is necessary to re-iterate that there is a shortage in resources in 
RMBS.  If I did not convey this to each of you I would be doing a disservice to each of 
you and the department.  As an update, December is going to be our busiest month ever 
in RMBS.  I am also concerned that there is a perception that we have been getting all the 
work done up until now and therefore can continue to do so. 

 

“We ran our Staffing model assuming the analysts are working 60 hours a week and we 
are short resources.  We could talk about the assumptions and make modifications but the 
results would be similar.  The analysts on average are working longer than this and we 
are burning them out.  We have had a couple of resignations and expect more.  It has 
come to my attention in the last couple of days that we have a number of staff members 
that are experiencing health issues.”1189

 

A May 2006 internal email from an S&P senior manager in the Structured Finance Real 

 
 
Estate Ratings Group expressed similar concerns: 
 

“We spend most of our time keeping each other and our staff calm. Tensions are high. 
Just too much work, not enough people, pressure from company, quite a bit of turnover 
and no coordination of the non-deal ‘stuff’ they want us and our staff to do ....”1190
 

  

The head of the S&P CDO Ratings Group sent a 2006 email to the head of the Structured 
Finance Department to make a similar point.  She wrote:  
 

“While I realize that our revenues and client service numbers don’t indicate any ill 
[e]ffects from our severe understaffing situation, I am more concerned than ever that we 
are on a downward spiral of morale, analytical leadership/quality and client service.”1191

Some of the groups came up with creative ways to address their staffing shortages.  For 

example, the head of the S&P RMBS Ratings Group between 2005 and 2007, Susan Barnes, 
advised the Subcommittee that her group regularly borrowed staff from the S&P Surveillance 
Group to assist with new ratings.   She said that almost half the surveillance staff provided 
assistance on issuing new ratings during her tenure, and estimated that each person in the 
surveillance group might have contributed up to 25% of his or her time to issuing new 
ratings.1192
 
 
The Subcommittee investigation discovered a cadre of professional RMBS and CDO 
rating analysts who were rushed, overworked, and demoralized.  They were asked to evaluate 
increasing numbers of increasingly complex financial instruments at high speed, using out-of-
date rating models and unclear ratings criteria, while acting under pressure from management to 
increase market share and revenues and pressure from investment banks to ignore credit risk.  
These analysts were short staffed even as their employers collected record revenues.   
 
 
credit rating agencies to conduct surveillance on outstanding rated RMBS and CDO securities to 
evaluate their credit risk.  The credit rating agencies were contractually obligated to monitor the 
accuracy of the ratings they issued over the life of the rated transactions.  CRA surveillance 
analysts were supposed to evaluate each rating on an ongoing basis to determine whether the 
rating should be affirmed, upgraded, or downgraded.  To support this analysis, both companies 
collected substantial annual surveillance fees from the issuers of the financial instruments they 
rated, and set up surveillance groups to review the ratings.  In the case of RMBS and CDO 
securities, the Subcommittee investigation found evidence that these surveillance groups may 
have lacked the resources to properly monitor the thousands of rated products. 
 
 
were responsible for tracking over 13,000 rated CDO securities: 
 

Resource-Starved Surveillance.  Resource shortages also impacted the ability of the 

At Moody’s, for example, a 2007 email disclosed that about 26 surveillance analysts 

“Thanks for sharing the draft of the CDO surveillance piece you’re planning to publish 
later this week.  …  In the section about your CDO surveillance infrastructure, we were 
struck by the data point about the 26 professionals who are dedicated to monitoring CDO 
ratings.  While this is, no doubt, a strong team, we wanted to at least raise the question 
about whether the company’s critics could twist that number – e.g., by comparing it to the 
13,000+ CDOs you’re monitoring – and once again question if you have adequate 
resources to do your job effectively. Given that potential risk, we thought you might 
consider removing any specific reference to the number of people on the CDO 
surveillance team.”1193
 
 
The evidence of surveillance shortages at S&P was particularly telling.  Although during 
an interview with the Subcommittee, the head of S&P’s RMBS Surveillance Group from 2001 to 
2008, Ernestine Warner, said she had adequate resources to conduct surveillance of rated RMBS

period, she repeatedly described and complained about a lack of resources that was impeding her 
group’s ability to complete its work.  In the spring of 2006, she emailed her colleague about her 
growing anxiety:   
 

  In emails sent over a two-year 

“RMBS has an all time high of 5900 transactions.  Each time I consider what my group is 
faced with, I become more and more anxious.  The situation with Lal [a surveillance 
analyst], being off line or out of the group, is having a huge impact.”1195

 

 
In June 2006, she wrote that the problems were not getting better: 
 

“It really feels like I am repeating myself when it comes to completing a very simple 
project and addressing some of the other surveillance needs.  … The inability to make a 
decision about how the project is going to be resourced is causing undue stress.  I have 
talked to you and Peter [D’Erchia, head of global structured finance surveillance,] about 
each of the issues below and at this point I am not sure what else you need from me.  … 
 
To rehash the points below: 
 
In addition to the project above that involves some 863 deals, I have a back log of deals 
that are out of date with regard to ratings.  … We recognize that I am still 
understaffed with these two additional bodies.  … [W]e may be falling further behind at 
the rate the deals are closing.  If we do not agree on the actual number, certainly we can 
agree that I need more recourse if I am ever going to be near compliance.”1196
 

 

In December 2006, she wrote: 
 

308 

 

“In light of the current state of residential mortgage performance, especially sub-prime, I 
think it would be very beneficial for the RMBS surveillance team to have the work being 
done by the temps to continue.  It is still very important that performance data is loaded 
on a timely basis as this has an impact on our exception reports.  Currently, there are 
nearly 1,000 deals with data loads aged beyond one month.”1197
 
In February 2007, she expressed concerns about having adequate resources to address 

 

potential downgrades in RMBS:   
 

“I talked to Tommy yesterday and he thinks that the [RMBS] ratings are not going to 
hold through 2007.  He asked me to begin discussing taking rating actions earlier on the 

                                                 
1194 During an interview, the head of RMBS surveillance advised that she believed she was adequately resourced and 
prioritized her review of outstanding securities by focusing on 2006 and 2007 vintages that had performance 
problems.  Subcommittee interview of Ernestine Warner (3/11/2010).

poor performing deals.  I have been thinking about this for much of the night.  We do not 
have the resources to support what we are doing now.  A new process, without the right 
support, would be overwhelming. ...  My group is under serious pressure to respond to the 
burgeoning poor performance of sub-prime deals. … we are really falling behind. … I am 
seeing evidence that I really need to add staff to keep up with what is going on with sub 
prime and mortgage performance in general, NOW.”1198
 
In April 2007, a managing director at S&P in the Structured Finance Group wrote an 

  

email confirming the staffing shortages in the RMBS Surveillance Group: 
 

“We have worked together with Ernestine Warner (EW) to produce a staffing model for 
RMBS Surveillance (R-Surv).  It is intended to measure the staffing needed for detailed 
surveillance of the 2006 vintage and also everything issued prior to that.  This model 
shows that the R-Surv staff is short by 7 FTE [Full Time Employees] - about 3 Directors, 
2 AD’s, and 2 Associates.  The model suggests that the current staff may have been right 
sized if we excluded coverage of the 2006 vintage, but was under titled lacking sufficient 
seniority, skill, and experience.”1199
 
The global head of the S&P Structured Finance Surveillance Group, Peter D’Erchia, told 

 

the Subcommittee that, in late 2006, he expressed concerns to senior management about 
surveillance resources and the need to downgrade subprime in more significant numbers in light 
of the deteriorating subprime market.1200
director of the Global Structured Finance Ratings Group, Joanne Rose, disagreed with him about 
the need to issue significantly more downgrades in subprime RMBS and this disagreement 
continued into the next year.   He also told the Subcommittee that after this disagreement with 
her, he received a disappointing 2007 performance evaluation.  He wrote the following in the 
employee comment section of his evaluation:  

  According to Mr. D’Erchia, the executive managing 

 
“Even more offensive – and flatly wrong – is the statement that I am not working for a 
good outcome for S&P.  That is all I am working towards and have been for 26 years.  It 
is hard to respond to such comments, which I think reflect Joanne’s [Rose] personal 
feelings arising from our disagreement over subprime debt deterioration, not professional 
assessment. … Such comments, and others like it, suggest to me that this year-end 
appraisal, in contrast to the mid-year appraisal, has more to do with our differences over 
subprime deterioration than an objective assessment of my overall performance.”1201
 
In 2008, Mr. D’Erchia was removed from his surveillance position, where he oversaw 

 
more than 314 employees, as part of a reduction in force.  He was subsequently rehired as a 
managing director in U.S. Public Finance at S&P, a position without staff to supervise.

Similarly, Ernestine Warner, the head of RMBS Surveillance, lost her managerial position and 
was reassigned to investor relations in the Structured Finance Group. 

 
On July 10, 2007, amid record mortgage defaults, S&P abruptly began downgrading its 

outstanding RMBS and CDO ratings.  In July alone, it downgraded the ratings of more than 
1,000 RMBS and 100 CDO securities.  Both credit rating agencies continued to issue significant 
downgrades throughout the remainder of 2007.  On January 30, 2008, S&P took action on over 
8,200 RMBS and CDO ratings – meaning it either downgraded their ratings or placed the 
securities on credit watch with negative implications.  These and other downgrades, matched by 
equally substantial numbers at Moody’s, paint a picture of CRA surveillance teams acting at top 
speed in overwhelming circumstances to correct thousands of inaccurate RMBS and CDO 
ratings.  When asked to produce contemporaneous decision-making documents indicating how 
and when the ratings were selected for downgrade, neither S&P nor Moody’s produced 
meaningful documentation.  The facts suggest that CRA surveillance analysts with already 
substantial responsibilities and limited resources were forced to go into overdrive to clean up 
ratings that could not “hold.”     
 

(6)   Mortgage Fraud   
A final factor that contributed to inaccurate credit ratings involves mortgage fraud.  

310 

 

Although the credit rating agencies were clearly aware of increased levels of mortgage fraud, 
they did not factor that credit risk into their quantitative models or adequately factor it into their 
qualitative analyses.  The absence of that credit risk meant that the credit enhancements they 
required were insufficient, the tranches bearing AAA ratings were too large, and the ratings they 
issued were too optimistic. 

 
Reports of mortgage fraud were frequent and mounted yearly prior to the financial crisis.  
As noted above, as early as 2004, the FBI began issuing reports on increased mortgage fraud.1202  
The FBI was also quoted in Congressional testimony and in the popular press about the mortgage 
fraud problem.  CNN reported that “[r]ampant fraud in the mortgage industry has increased so 
sharply that the FBI warned Friday of an ‘epidemic’ of financial crimes which, if not curtailed, 
could become ‘the next S&L crisis.’”1203  In 2006, the FBI reported that the number of 
Suspicious Activity Reports on mortgage fraud had increased sixfold, from about 6,800 in 2002, 
to about 36,800 in 2006, while pending mortgage fraud cases nearly doubled from 436 in FY 
2003 to 818 in FY 2006.1204  The Mortgage Asset Research Institute, LLC (MARI) also reported 
increasing mortgage fraud over several years, including a 30% increase in 2006 alone.1205

Published reports, as well as internal emails, demonstrate that analysts within both 
Moody’s and S&P were aware of the serious mortgage fraud problem in the industry.1206  
Despite being on notice about the problem and despite assertions about the importance of loan 
data quality in the ratings process for structured finance securities,1207 neither Moody’s nor S&P 
established procedures to account for the possibility of fraud in its ratings process.  For example, 
neither company took any steps to ensure that the loan data provided for specific RMBS loan 
pools had been reviewed for accuracy.1208  The former head of S&P’s RMBS Group, Frank 
Raiter, stated in his prepared testimony for the Subcommittee hearing that the S&P rating 
process did not include any “due diligence” review of the loan tape or any requirement for the 
provider of the loan tape to certify its accuracy.  He stated:  “We were discouraged from even 
using the term ‘due diligence’ as it was believed to expose S&P to liability.”1209  Fraud was also 
not factored into the RMBS or CDO quantitative models.1210
 
 
securities in July 2007, they directed some of the blame for the rating errors on the volume of 
mortgage fraud.  On July 10, 2007, when S&P announced that it was placing 612 U.S. subprime 
RMBS on negative credit watch, S&P noted the high incidence of fraud reported by MARI,  
“misrepresentations on credit reports,” and that “[d]ata quality concerning some of the borrower 
and loan characteristics provided during the rating process [had] also come under question.” 1211 
In October 2007, the CEO of Fitch Ratings, another ratings firm, said in an interview that “the 
blame may lie with fraudulent lending practices, not his industry.”1212
 Moody’s made similar 
observations.  In 2008, Moody’s CEO Ray McDaniel told a panel at the World Economic 
Forum: 
 

Yet when Moody’s and S&P initiated the mass downgrades of RMBS and CDO 

  

“In hindsight, it is pretty clear that there was a failure in some key assumptions that were 
supporting our analytics and our models. … [One reason for the failure was that the]

practices may have contributed to problems with ratings,” Associated Press, and noting:  “After S&P, Fitch is now 
blaming fraud for the impact on RMBS, at least partially.”).  

‘information quality’ [given to Moody’s,] both the complete[ness] and veracity, was 
deteriorating.”1213
 
In 2007, Fitch Ratings decided to conduct a review of some mortgage loan files to 

  

evaluate the impact of poor lending standards on loan quality.  On November 28, 2007, Fitch 
issued a report entitled, “The Impact of Poor Underwriting Practices and Fraud in Subprime 
RMBS Performance.”  After reviewing a “sample of 45 subprime loans, targeting high CLTV 
[combined loan to value] [and] stated documentation loans, including many with early missed 
payments,” Fitch reported that it decided to summarize information about the impact of fraud, as 
well as lax lending standards, on the mortgages.  Fitch explained: “[t]he result of the analysis 
was disconcerting at best, as there was the appearance of fraud or misrepresentation in almost 
every file.”1214

 

 
 To address concerns about fraud and lax underwriting standards generally, S&P 

considered a potential policy change in November 2007 that would give an evaluation of the 
quality of services provided by third parties more influence in the ratings process.  An S&P 
managing director wrote: 

312 

 

 
“We believe our analytical process and rating opinions will be enhanced by an increased 
focus on the role third parties can play in influencing loan default and loss performance.  
…  [W]e’d like to set up meetings where specific mortgage originators, investment banks 
and mortgage servicers are discussed.  We would like to use these meetings to share ideas 
with a goal of determining whether loss estimates should be altered based upon your 
collective input.”1215
 

   

 

An S&P employee who received this announcement wrote to a colleague:  “Should have been 
doing this all along.” 1216
 

S&P later decided that its analysts would also review specific loan originators that 
supplied loans for the pool.  Loans issued by originators with a reputation for issuing poor 
quality loans, including loans marked by fraud, would be considered a greater credit risk and 
ratings for the pool containing the loans would reflect that risk.  S&P finalized that policy in 
November 2008.1217  As part of its ratings analysis, S&P now ranks mortgage originators based 
on the past historical performance of their loans and factors the assessment of the originator into 
credit enhancement levels for RMBS.1218

In September 2007, Moody’s solicited industry feedback on proposed enhancements to 

 
its evaluation of nonprime RMBS securitizations, including the need for third-party due 
diligence reviews of the loans in a securitization.  Moody’s wrote:  “To improve the accuracy of 
loan information upon which it relies, Moody’s will look for additional oversight by a qualified 
third party.”1219  In November 2008, Moody’s issued a report detailing its enhanced approach to 
RMBS originator assessments.1220

 

   
E.  Preventing Inflated Credit Ratings 

 

313 

 

Weak credit rating agency performance has long been a source of concern to financial 

 
 
regulators.  Many investors rely on credit ratings to identify “safe” investments.  Many regulated 
financial institutions, including banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies, pension funds, 
mutual funds, money market funds, and others have been required to operate under restrictions 
related to their purchase of “investment grade” versus “noninvestment grade” financial 
instruments.  When credit agencies issue inaccurate credit ratings, both retail investors and 
regulated financial institutions may mistakenly purchase financial instruments that are riskier 
than they intended or are permitted to buy.  The recent financial crisis has demonstrated how the 
unintended purchase of high risk financial products by multiple investors and financial 
institutions can create systemic risk and endanger, not only U.S. financial markets, but the entire 
U.S. economy.    
 

(1)   Past Credit Rating Agency Oversight 
Even before the recent financial crisis, the SEC and Congress had been reviewing the 
need for increased regulatory oversight of the credit rating industry.  In 1994, for example, the 
SEC “issued a Concept Release soliciting public comment on the appropriate role of ratings in 
the federal securities laws, and the need to establish formal procedures for recognizing and 
monitoring the activities of [credit rating agencies].”1221

credit ratings to the company “until a mere four days before Enron declared bankruptcy.”1222

aware of – until it was too late because they did not exercise the proper diligence.  … 
[T]he agencies did not perform a thorough analysis of Enron’s public filings; did not pay 
appropriate attention to allegations of financial fraud; and repeatedly took company 
officials at their word … despite indications that the company had misled the rating 
agencies in the past.”1223
 

   

 

The report also found the credit rating “analysts [did] not view themselves as accountable for 
their actions,” since the rating agencies were subject to little regulation or oversight, and their 
liability for poor quality ratings was limited by regulatory exemptions and First Amendment 
protections.1224  The report recommended “increased oversight for these rating agencies in order 
to ensure that the public’s trust in these firms is well-placed.”1225
 
 
In 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act required the SEC to conduct a study into the role of 
credit rating agencies in the securities markets, including any barriers to accurately evaluating 
the financial condition of the issuers of securities they rate.1226  In response, the SEC initiated an 
in-depth study of the credit rating industry and released its findings in a 2003 report.  The SEC’s 
oversight efforts “included informal discussions with credit rating agencies and market 
participants, formal examinations of credit rating agencies, and public hearings, where market 
participants were given the opportunity to offer their views on credit rating agencies and their 
role in the capital markets.”1227  The report expressed a number of concerns about CRA 
operations, including “potential conflicts of interest caused by the [issuer-pays model].”1228
 
 
was designed to address some of the shortcomings identified by Congress and the SEC.  The Act 
made it clear that the SEC had jurisdiction to conduct oversight of the credit rating industry, and 
formally charged the agency with designating companies as NRSROs.1229  The statute also 
required NRSROs to meet certain criteria before registering with the SEC.  In addition, the 
statute instructed the SEC to promulgate regulations requiring NRSROs to establish policies and 
procedures to prevent the misuse of nonpublic information and to disclose and manage conflicts 
of interest.1230
 
 
In the summer of 2007, after the mass downgrades of RMBS and CDO ratings had begun 
and as the financial crisis began to intensify, the SEC initiated its first examinations of the major

credit rating agencies.  According to the SEC, “[t]he purpose of the examinations was to develop 
an understanding of the practices of the rating agencies surrounding the rating of RMBS and 
CDOs.”1231  The examinations reviewed CRA practices from January 2004 to December 2007.  
In 2008, the SEC issued a report summarizing its findings.  The report found that “there was a 
substantial increase in the number and in the complexity of RMBS and CDO deals,” “significant 
aspects of the ratings process were not always disclosed,” the ratings policies and procedures 
were not fully documented, “the surveillance processes used by the rating agencies appear to 
have been less robust than the processes used for initial ratings,” and the “rating agencies’ 
internal audit processes varied significantly.”1232  In addition, the report raised a number of 
conflict of interest issues that influenced the ratings process, noted that the rating agencies failed 
to verify the accuracy or quality of the loan data used to derive their ratings, and raised questions 
about the factors that were or were not used to derive the credit ratings.1233
 

  

(2) New Developments    
 
Although the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 strengthened oversight of the 

credit rating agencies, Congress passed further reforms in response to the financial crisis to 
address weaknesses in regulatory oversight of the credit rating industry.  The Dodd-Frank Act 
dedicated an entire subtitle to those credit rating reforms which substantially broadened the 
powers of the SEC to oversee and regulate the credit rating industry and explicitly allowed 
investors, for the first time, to file civil suits against credit rating agencies.1234
  The major 
reforms include the following: 

 

a.  establishment of a new SEC Office of Credit Ratings charged with overseeing the 

credit rating industry, including by conducting at least annual NRSRO examinations 
whose reports must be made public;  

b.  SEC authority to discipline, fine, and deregister a credit rating agency and associated 

personnel for violating the law; 

c.  SEC authority to deregister a credit rating agency for issuing poor ratings; 
d.  authority for investors to file private causes of action against credit rating agencies 

that knowingly or recklessly fail to conduct a reasonable investigation of a rated 
product; 

e.   requirements for credit rating agencies to establish internal controls to ensure high 
quality ratings and disclose information about their rating methodologies and about 
each issued rating; 

                                                 
1231 7/2008 “Summary Report of Issues Identified in the Commission Staff’s Examinations of Select Credit Rating 
Agencies,” prepared by the SEC, at 1.  The CRAs examined by the SEC were not formally subject to the Credit 
Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 or its implementing SEC regulations until September 2007. 
1232 Id. at 1-2. 
1233 Id. at 14, 17-18, 23-29, 31-37. 
1234 See Title IX, Subtitle C – Improvements to the Regulation of Credit Rating Agencies of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

f.  amendments to federal statutes removing references to credit ratings and credit rating 

agencies in order to reduce reliance on ratings; 

316 

 

g.   a GAO study to evaluate alternative compensation models for ratings that would 

create financial incentives to issue more accurate ratings; and  

h.   an SEC study of the conflicts of interest affecting ratings of structured finance 

products, followed by the mandatory development of a plan to reduce ratings 
shopping.1235

 

The Act stated that these reforms were needed, “[b]ecause of the systemic importance of 

credit ratings and the reliance placed on credit ratings by individual and institutional investors 
and financial regulators,” and because “credit rating agencies are central to capital formation, 
investor confidence, and the efficient performance of the United States economy.”
 
            (3)  Recommendations 
 

1236

 

To further strengthen the accuracy of credit ratings and reduce systemic risk, this Report 

makes the following recommendations. 

 
1.  Rank Credit Rating Agencies by Accuracy.  The SEC should use its regulatory 

authority to rank the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations in terms 
of performance, in particular the accuracy of their ratings. 

   
2.  Help Investors Hold CRAs Accountable.  The SEC should use its regulatory 

authority to facilitate the ability of investors to hold credit rating agencies accountable 
in civil lawsuits for inflated credit ratings, when a credit rating agency knowingly or 
recklessly fails to conduct a reasonable investigation of the rated security. 

 
3.  Strengthen CRA Operations.  The SEC should use its inspection, examination, and 
regulatory authority to ensure credit rating agencies institute internal controls, credit 
rating methodologies, and employee conflict of interest safeguards that advance 
rating accuracy. 

 
4.  Ensure CRAs Recognize Risk.  The SEC should use its inspection, examination, and 

regulatory authority to ensure credit rating agencies assign higher risk to financial 
instruments whose performance cannot be reliably predicted due to their novelty or 
complexity, or that rely on assets from parties with a record for issuing poor quality 
assets.

2010). 
1236 See Section 931 of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

317 

 

5.  Strengthen Disclosure.  The SEC should exercise its authority under the new Section 

78o-7(s) of Title 15 to ensure that the credit rating agencies complete the required 
new ratings forms by the end of the year and that the new forms provide 
comprehensible, consistent, and useful ratings information to investors, including by 
testing the proposed forms with actual investors. 

 

 
 

6.   Reduce Ratings Reliance. Federal regulators should reduce the federal government’s 

reliance on privately issued credit ratings.

VI.   INVESTMENT BANK ABUSES:
        CASE STUDY OF GOLDMAN SACHS AND DEUTSCHE BANK

A key factor in the recent financial crisis was the role played by complex financial

instruments, often referred to as structured finance products, such as residential mortgage backed
securities (RMBS), collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), and credit default swaps (CDS),
including CDS contracts linked to the ABX Index. These financial products were envisioned,
engineered, sold, and traded by major U.S. investment banks.

1238

 

1239

  Those fees contributed substantial revenues to the investment banks which set

From 2004 to 2008, U.S. financial institutions issued nearly $2.5 trillion in RMBS
securities and over $1.4 trillion in CDOs securitizing primarily mortgage related products.
1237
Investment banks charged fees ranging from $1 to $8 million to act as the underwriter of an
RMBS securitization,
 and from $5 to $10 million to act as the placement agent for a CDO
securitization.
up structured finance groups, and a variety of RMBS and CDO origination and trading desks
within those groups, to handle mortgage related securitizations.  Investment banks placed these
securities with investors around the world, and helped develop a secondary market where private
RMBS and CDO securities could be bought and sold.  The investment banks’ trading desks
participated in those secondary markets, buying and selling RMBS and CDO securities either for
their customers or for themselves.

Some of these financial products allowed investors to profit, not only from the success of
an RMBS or CDO securitization, but also from its failure.  CDS contracts, for example, allowed
counterparties to wager on the rise or fall in the value of a specific RMBS security or on a
collection of RMBS and other assets contained or referenced in a CDO.  Major investment banks
also developed standardized CDS contracts that could be traded on a secondary market.  In

does not include about $6.6 trillion in RMBS securities issued by government sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac.
1238
  See, e.g., 2/2011 chart, “Goldman Sachs Expected Profit from RMBS Securitizations,” prepared by the U.S.
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations using Goldman-produced documents for securitizations from

bank that created it between $5 million and $10 million – about half of which usually ended up as employee bonuses. 
Indeed, Wall Street awarded record bonuses in 2006, a hefty chunk of which came from the CDO business.”).  Fee
information obtained by the Subcommittee is consistent with this range of CDO fees.  For example, Deutsche Bank
received nearly $5 million in fees for Gemstone 7, and the head of its CDO Group said that Deutsche Bank received
typically between $5 and 10 million in fees, while Goldman Sachs charged a range of $5 to $30 million in fees for

addition, they established the ABX Index which allowed counterparties to wager on the rise or
fall in the value of a basket of subprime RMBS securities, and which could be used to reflect the
state of the subprime mortgage market as a whole.  

Investment banks sometimes matched up parties who wanted to take opposite sides in a

structured finance transaction, and other times took one or the other side of a transaction to
accommodate a client.  At still other times, investment banks used these financial instruments to
make their own proprietary wagers.  In extreme cases, some investments banks set up structured
finance transactions which enabled them to profit at the expense of their clients. 

Two case studies, involving Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, illustrate a variety of

troubling and sometimes abusive practices involving the origination or use of RMBS, CDO,
CDS, and ABX financial instruments.  Those practices included at times constructing RMBS or
CDOs with assets that senior employees within the investment banks knew were of poor quality;
underwriting securitizations for lenders known within the industry for issuing high risk, poor
quality mortgages or RMBS securities; selling RMBS or CDO securities without full disclosure
of the investment bank’s own adverse interests; and causing investors to whom they sold the
securities to incur substantial losses.

In the case of Goldman Sachs, the practices included exploiting conflicts of interest with

the firm’s clients.  For example, Goldman used CDS and ABX contracts to place billions of
dollars of bets that specific RMBS securities, baskets of RMBS securities, or collections of assets
in CDOs would fall in value, while at the same time convincing customers to invest in new
RMBS and CDO securities.  In one instance, Goldman took the entire short side of a $2 billion
CDO known as Hudson 1, selected assets for the CDO to transfer risk from Goldman’s own
holdings, allowed investors to buy the CDO securities without fully disclosing its own short
position, and when the CDO lost value, made a $1.7 billion gain at the expense of the clients to
whom it had sold the securities.  While Goldman sometimes told customers that it might take an
adverse investment position to the RMBS or CDO securities it was selling them, Goldman did
not disclose that, in fact, it already had significant proprietary investments that would pay off if
the particular security it was selling or if RMBS and CDO securities in general fell in value.  In
another instance, Goldman marketed a CDO known as Abacus 2007-AC1 to clients without
disclosing that it had allowed the sole short party in the CDO, a hedge fund, to play a major role
in selecting the assets.  The Abacus securities quickly lost value, and the three long investors
together lost $1 billion, while the hedge fund profited by about the same amount.  In still other
instances, Goldman took on the role of a collateral put provider or liquidation agent in a CDO,
and leveraged that role to obtain added financial benefits to the fiscal detriment of the clients to
whom it sold the CDO securities. 

In the case of Deutsche Bank, during 2006 and 2007, the bank’s top CDO trader, Greg

Lippmann, repeatedly warned and advised his Deutsche Bank colleagues and some of his clients
seeking to buy short positions about the poor quality of the RMBS securities underlying many
CDOs, describing some of those securities  as “crap” and “pigs.”  At one point, Mr. Lippmann

320

was asked to buy a specific CDO security and responded that it “rarely trades,” but he “would
take it and try to dupe someone” into buying it.  He also disparaged RMBS securities that, at the
same time, were being included in Gemstone 7, a CDO being assembled by the bank for sale to
investors.  Gemstone 7 included or referenced 115 RMBS securities, many of which carried
BBB, BBB-, or even BB credit ratings, making them among the highest risk RMBS securities
sold to the public, yet received AAA ratings for its top three tranches.  Deutsche Bank sold $700
million in Gemstone securities to eight investors who saw their investments rapidly incur
delinquencies, rating downgrades, and losses.  Mr. Lippmann at times referred to the industry’s
ongoing CDO marketing efforts as a “CDO machine” or “ponzi scheme,” and predicted that the
U.S. mortgage market as a whole would eventually plummet in value.  Deutsche Bank’s senior
management disagreed with his negative views, and used the bank’s own funds to make large
proprietary investments in mortgage related securities that, in 2007, had a notional or face value
of $128 billion and a market value of more than $25 billion.  At the same time, Deutsche Bank
allowed Mr. Lippmann to develop for the bank a $5 billion proprietary short position in the
RMBS market, which it later cashed in for a profit of approximately $1.5 billion.  Despite that
gain, in 2007, due to its substantial long investments, Deutsche Bank incurred an overall loss of
about $4.5 billion from its mortgage related proprietary investments.  

The two case studies illustrate how investment banks engaged in high intensity sales
efforts to market new CDOs in 2007, even as U.S. mortgage delinquencies climbed, RMBS
securities incurred losses, the U.S. mortgage market as a whole deteriorated, and investors lost
confidence.  They demonstrate how these investment banks benefitted from structured finance
fees, and had little incentive to stop producing and selling high risk, poor quality structured
finance products.  They also illustrate how the development of complex structured finance
products, such as synthetic CDOs and naked credit default swaps, amplified market risk by
allowing investors with no ownership interest in the “reference obligations” to place unlimited
side bets on their performance.  Finally, the two case histories demonstrate how proprietary
trading led to dramatic losses in the case of Deutsche Bank and to conflicts of interest in the case
of Goldman Sachs.  

Investment banks were a major driving force behind the structured finance products that
provided a steady stream of funding for lenders to originate high risk, poor quality loans and that
magnified risk throughout the U.S. financial system.  The investment banks that engineered, sold,
traded, and profited from mortgage related structured finance products were a major cause of the
financial crisis.

321

A.  Background

(1)  Investment Banks In General

Historically, investment banks helped raise capital for business and other endeavors by
helping to design, finance, and sell financial products like stocks or bonds.  When a corporation
needed capital to fund a large construction project, for example, it often hired an investment bank
either to arrange a bank loan or to raise capital by designing, financing, and marketing an issue of
shares or corporate bonds for sale to investors.  Investment banks performed these services in
exchange for fees. 

Today, investment banks also participate in a wide range of other financial activities,
including providing broker-dealer and investment advisory services, and trading commodities
and derivatives.  Investment banks also often engage in proprietary trading, meaning trading with
their own money and not on behalf of a customer.  Many investment banks are structured today
as affiliates of one or more banks.

Under the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, certain types of financial institutions had been

prohibited from commingling their services.  For example, with limited exceptions, only broker-
dealers could provide brokerage services; only banks could offer banking; and only insurers
could offer insurance.  Each financial sector had its own primary regulator who was generally
prohibited from regulating services outside of its jurisdiction.
  Glass-Steagall also contained
  One reason for keeping the sectors separate was to

ensure that banks with federally insured deposits did not engage in the type of high risk activities
that might be the bread and butter of a broker-dealer or commodities trader.  Another reason was
to avoid the conflicts of interest that might arise, for example, from a financial institution
pressuring its clients to obtain all of its financial services from the same firm.  A third reason was
to avoid the conflicts of interest that arise when a financial institution is allowed to act for its
own benefit in a proprietary capacity, while at the same time acting on behalf of customers in an
agency or fiduciary capacity.

1240

1241

Glass-Steagall was repealed in 1999, after which the barriers between banks, broker-
dealers, and insurance firms fell.  U.S. financial institutions not only began offering a mix of
financial services, but also intensified their proprietary trading activities.  The resulting changes
in the way financial institutions were organized and operated made it more difficult for regulators
to distinguish between activities intended to benefit customers versus the financial institution
itself.  The expanded set of financial services investment banks were allowed to offer also
contributed to the multiple and significant conflicts of interest that arose between some
investment banks and their clients during the financial crisis. 

  Federal law has never established a “super-regulator” with  jurisdiction to police compliance and conduct across

1240
banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and insurance sectors, and that remains the case today.
1241

  See Section 16 of the Banking Act of 1933, Pub. L. 73-66 (also known as the Glass-Steagall Act).

322

(2)  Roles and Duties of an Investment Bank:
       Market Maker, Underwriter, Placement Agent, Broker-Dealer  

Investment banks typically play a variety of significant roles when dealing with their

clients, including that of market maker, underwriter, placement agent, and broker-dealer.  Each
role brings different legal obligations under federal securities law.

Market Maker.   A “market maker” is typically a dealer in financial instruments that

1242

stands ready to buy and sell for its own account a particular financial instrument on a regular and
continuous basis at a publicly quoted price.
  A major responsibility of a market maker is
filling orders on behalf of customers.  Market markers do not solicit customers; instead they
maintain, buy, and sell quotes in a public setting, demonstrating their readiness to either buy or
sell the specified security, and customers come to them.  For example, a market maker in a
particular stock typically posts the prices at which it is willing to buy or sell that stock, attracting
customers based on the competitiveness of its prices.  This activity by market makers helps
provide liquidity and efficiency in the trading market for the security.
  It is common for a
particular security to have multiple market makers who competitively quote the security.   

1243

Market makers generally use the same inventory of assets to carry out both their market-
making and proprietary trading activities.  Market makers are allowed, in certain circumstances
specified by the SEC, to sell securities short in situations to satisfy market demand when they do
not have the securities in their inventory in order to provide liquidity.  Market makers have among
the most narrow disclosure obligations under federal securities law, since they do not actively
solicit clients or make investment recommendations to them.  Their disclosure obligations are
generally limited to providing fair and accurate information related to the execution of a particular
trade.
market manipulation.  In addition, they are subject to legal requirements relating to the handling
of customer orders, for example using best execution efforts when placing a client’s buy or sell
order.1245

  Market makers are also subject to the securities laws’ prohibitions against fraud and

1244

Underwriter and Placement Agent.  If an investment bank agrees to act as an

“underwriter” for the issuance of a new security to the public, such as an RMBS, it typically

1242
  Section 3(a)(38) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 states:  “The term “market maker” means any specialist
permitted to act as a dealer, any dealer acting in the capacity of block positioner, and any dealer who, with respect to
a security, holds himself out (by entering quotations in an inter-dealer communications system or otherwise) as being
willing to buy and sell such security for his own account on a regular or continuous basis.”  See also SEC website,

purchases the securities from the issuer, holds them on its books, conducts the public offering, and
bears the financial risk until the securities are sold to the public.  By law, securities sold to the
public must be registered with the SEC.  Underwriters help issuers prepare and file the registration
statements filed with the SEC, which explain to potential investors the purpose of a proposed
public offering, the issuer’s operations and management, key financial data, and other important
facts.  Any offering document, or prospectus, given to the investing public in connection with a
registered security must also be filed with the SEC.  

If a security is not offered to the general public, it can still be offered to investors through

a “private placement.”  Investment banks often act as the “placement agent,” performing
intermediary services between those seeking to raise money and investors.  Placement agents
often help issuers design the securities, produce the offering materials, and market the new
securities to investors.  Offering documents in connection with private placements are exempt
from SEC registration and are not filed with the SEC. 

In the years leading up to the financial crisis, RMBS securities were registered with the
SEC, while CDOs were sold to investors through private placements.  Both of these securities
were also traded in a secondary market by market makers.  Investment banks sold both types of
securities primarily to large institutional investors, such as other banks, pension funds, insurance
companies, municipalities, university endowments, and hedge funds.

Whether acting as an underwriter or placement agent, a major part of the investment

bank’s responsibility is to solicit customers to buy the new securities being offered.  Under the
securities laws, investment banks that act as an underwriter or placement agent for new securities
are liable for any material misrepresentation or omission of a material fact made in connection
with a solicitation or sale of those securities to investors.

1246

  

The obligation of an underwriter and placement agent to disclose material facts to every

investor it solicits comes from two sources:  the duties as an underwriter specifically, and the
duties as a broker-dealer generally.  With respect to duties relating to being an underwriter, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit observed that underwriters have a “unique position” in
the securities industry:

  See Sections 11 and 12 of Securities Act of 1933. See also Rule 10b-5 of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934. 

1246
See also, e.g., SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 201 (1963) (“Experience has shown that
disclosure in such situations, while not onerous to the advisor, is needed to preserve the climate of fair dealing which
is so essential to maintain public confidence in the securities industry and to preserve the economic health of the
country.”).  See also SEC Study on Investment Advisers and Broker-Dealers at 51 (citations omitted) (“Under the so-
called ‘shingle’ theory …, a broker-dealer makes an implicit representation to those persons with whom it transacts
business that it will deal fairly with them, consistent with the standards of the profession. …  Actions taken by the
broker-dealer that are not fair to the customer must be disclosed in order to make this implied representation of
fairness not misleading.”). 

324

“[T]he relationship between the underwriter and its customer implicitly involves a
favorable recommendation of the issued security.  …  Although the underwriter cannot be
a guarantor of the soundness of any issue, he may not give it his implied stamp of approval

In addition, Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 makes underwriters liable to any
investor in any registered security if any part of the registration statement “contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.”1248

Broker-Dealer.  Broker-dealers also have affirmative disclosure obligations to their

clients.  With respect to the duties of a broker-dealer, the SEC has held:

“[W]hen a securities dealer recommends a stock to a customer, it is not only obligated to
avoid affirmative misstatements, but also must disclose material adverse facts to which it
is aware.  That includes disclosure of ‘adverse interests’ such as ‘economic self interest’
that could have influenced its recommendation.”

1249

  

To help broker-dealers understand when they are obligated to disclose material adverse
facts to investors, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has further defined the
term “recommendation”: 

“[A] broad range of circumstances may cause a transaction to be considered
recommended, and this determination does not depend on the classification of the
transaction by a particular member as ‘solicited’ or ‘unsolicited.’  In particular a
transaction will be considered to be recommended when the member or its associated
person brings a specific security to the attention of the customer through any means,
including, but not limited to, direct telephone communication, the delivery of promotional
material through the mail, or the transmission of electronic messages.”1250

There is no indication in any law or regulation that the obligation to disclose material
adverse facts is diminished or waived in relation to the level of sophistication of the potential
investor.1251

(3)  Structured Finance Products

325

Over time, investment banks have devised, marketed, and sold increasingly complex
financial instruments to investors, often referred to as “structured finance” products.  These
products include residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), collateralized debt obligations
(CDOs), and credit default swaps (CDS), including CDS contracts linked to the ABX Index, all of
which played a central role in the financial crisis.    

RMBS and CDO Securities.  RMBS and CDO securities are two common types of
structured finance products.  RMBS securities contain pools of mortgage loans, while CDOs
contain or reference pools of RMBS securities and other assets.  RMBS concentrate risk by
including thousands of subprime and other high risk home loans, with similar characteristics and
risks, in a single financial instrument.  Mortgage related CDOs concentrate risk even more by
including hundreds or thousands of RMBS securities, with similar characteristics and risks, in a
single financial instrument.  In addition, while some CDOs included only AAA rated RMBS
securities, others known as “mezzanine” CDOs contained RMBS securities that carried the riskier
BBB, BBB-, and even BB credit ratings and were more susceptible to losses if the underlying
mortgages began to incur delinquencies or defaults.  

Some investment banks went a step farther and assembled CDO securities into pools and

resecuritized them as so-called “CDO squared” instruments, which further concentrated the risk in
the underlying CDOs.
not contain any actual RMBS securities or other assets, but merely referenced them.  Some
devised “hybrid CDOs,” which contained a mix of cash and synthetic assets. 

   Some investment banks also assembled “synthetic CDOs,” which did

1252

The securitization process generated billions of dollars in funds that allowed investment
banks to supply financing to lenders to issue still more high risk mortgages and securities, which
investment banks and others then sold or securitized in exchange for still more fees.  This cycle
was repeated again and again, introducing more and more risk to a wider and wider range of
investors.  
 

Credit Default Swaps.  Some investment banks modified still another structured finance

product, a derivative known as a credit default swap (CDS), for use in the mortgage market. 
Much like an insurance contract, a CDS is a contract between two parties in which one party
guarantees payment to the other if the assets referenced in the contract lose value or experience a
negative credit event.  The party selling the insurance is referred to as the “long” party, since it
profits if the referenced asset performs well.  The party buying the insurance protection is referred
to as the “short” party, because it profits if the referenced asset performs poorly.

use the term “CDO^2.”   

  CDO squared transactions will generally be referred to in this Report as “CDO .”  Some Goldman materials also

The short party, or CDS buyer, typically pays periodic premiums, similar to insurance

premiums, to the long party or CDS seller, who has guaranteed the referenced assets against a loss
in value or a negative credit event such as a credit rating downgrade, default, or bankruptcy.  If the
loss or negative credit event occurs, the CDS seller is required to pay an agreed upon amount to
the CDS buyer.  Many CDS contracts also tracked the changing value of the referenced assets
over time, and required the long and short parties to post cash collateral with each other to secure
payment of their respective contractual obligations.  

CDS contracts that reference a single, specific security or bond for protection against a

loss in value or negative credit event have become known as “single name” CDS contracts.  Other
CDS contracts have been designed to protect a broader basket of securities, bonds, or other assets. 

By 2005, investment banks had standardized CDS contracts that referred to a “single

name” RMBS or CDO security.  Some investment banks and investors, which held large
inventories of RMBS and CDO securities, purchased those single name CDS contracts as a hedge
against possible losses in the value of their holdings.  Other investors, including investment banks,
began to purchase single name CDS contracts, not as a hedge to offset losses from the RMBS or
CDO securities they owned, but as a way to profit from particular RMBS or CDO securities they
predicted would lose value or fail.  CDS contracts that paid off on securities that were not owned
by the CDS buyer became known as “naked credit default swaps.”  Naked CDS contracts enabled
investors to bet against mortgage related assets, using the minimal capital needed to make the
periodic premium payments and collateral calls required by a CDS contract.

The key significance of the CDS product for the mortgage market was that it offered an

alternative to investing in RMBS and CDO securities that would perform well.  Single name CDS
contracts instead enabled investors to place their dollars in financial instruments that would pay
off if specific RMBS or CDO securities lost value or failed.

ABX Index.  In January 2006, a consortium of investment banks, led by Goldman Sachs
and Deutsche Bank, launched still another type of structured finance product, linked to a newly
created “ABX Index,” to enable investors to bet on multiple subprime RMBS securities at once. 
The ABX Index was administered by a private company called the Markit Group and consisted of
five separate indices, each of which tracked the performance of a different basket of 20 designated
subprime RMBS securities.
  The values of the securities in each basket were aggregated into a
single composite value that rose and fell over time.  Investors could then arrange, through a
broker-dealer, to enter into a CDS contract with another party using the ABX basket of subprime
RMBS securities as the “reference obligation” and the relevant ABX Index value as the agreed

1253

 Each of the five indices tracked a different basket of subprime RMBS securities.  One index tracked a basket of

1253
20 AAA rated RMBS securities; the second a basket of AA rated RMBS securities; and the remaining indices
tracked baskets of A, BBB, and BBB- rated RMBS securities.  Every six months, a new set of RMBS securities was
selected for each index.  See 3/2008 Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 318, “Understanding the
Securitization of Subprime Mortgage Credit,” at 26.  Markit Group Ltd. administered the ABX Index which issued
indices in 2006 and 2007, but has not issued any new indices since then.

327

upon value of that basket.  For a fee, investors could take either the “long” position, betting on the
rise of the index, or the “short” position, betting on the fall of the index, without having to
physically purchase or hold any of the referenced securities or raise the capital needed to pay for
the full face value of those referenced securities.  The index also used standardized CDS contracts
that remained in effect for a standard period of time, making it easier for investors to participate in
the market, and buy and sell ABX-linked CDS contracts.

The ABX Index allowed investors to place unlimited bets on the performance of one or
more of the subprime RMBS baskets.  It also made it easier and cheaper for investors, including
some investment banks, to short the subprime mortgage market in bulk.
  Investment banks not
only helped establish the ABX Index, they encouraged their clients to enter into CDS contracts
based upon the ABX Index, and used it themselves to bet on the mortgage market as a whole.  
The ABX Index expanded the risks inherent in the subprime mortgage market by providing
investors with a way to make unlimited investments in RMBS securities.  

1254

Synthetic CDOs.  By mid-2006, there was a large demand for RMBS and CDO securities

as well as a growing demand for CDS contracts to short the mortgage market.  To meet this
demand, investment banks and others began to make greater use of synthetic CDOs, which could
be assembled more quickly, since they did not require the CDO arranger to find and purchase
actual RMBS securities or other assets.  The increasing use of synthetic CDOs injected even
greater risk into the mortgage market by enabling investors to make unlimited wagers on various
groups of mortgage related assets and, if those assets performed poorly, expanding the number of
investors who would realize losses. 

Synthetic CDOs did not depend upon actual RMBS securities or other assets to bring in

cash to pay investors.  Instead, the CDO simply developed a list of existing RMBS or CDO
securities or other assets that would be used as its “reference obligations.”  The parties to the CDO
were not required to possess an ownership interest in any of those reference obligations; the CDO
simply tracked their performance over time.  The performance of the underlying reference
obligations, in the aggregate, determined the performance of the synthetic CDO.  

The synthetic CDO made or lost money for its investors by establishing a contractual

agreement that they would make payments to each other, based upon the aggregate performance
of the underlying referenced assets, using CDS contracts.  The “short” party essentially agreed to
make periodic payments, similar to insurance premiums, to the other party in exchange for an
agreement that the “long” party would pay the full face value of the synthetic CDO if the
underlying assets lost value or experienced a defined credit event such as a ratings downgrade.  In
essence, then, the synthetic CDO set up a wager in which the short party bet that its underlying
assets would perform poorly, while the long party bet that they would perform well.

(10/12/2010). 

328

Synthetic CDOs provided still another vehicle for investors looking to short the mortgage

market in bulk.  The synthetic CDO typically referenced a variety of RMBS securities.  One or
more investors could then take the “short” position and wager that the referenced securities as a
whole would fall in value or otherwise perform poorly.  Synthetic CDOs became a way for
investors to short multiple specific RMBS securities that they expected to incur delinquencies,
defaults, and losses. 

Synthetic CDOs magnified the risk in the mortgage market because arrangers had no limit
on the number of synthetic CDOs they could create.  In addition, multiple synthetic CDOs could
reference the same RMBS and CDO securities in various combinations, and sell financial
instruments dependent upon the same sets of high risk, poor quality loans over and over again to
various investors.  Since every synthetic CDO had to have a “short” party betting on the failure of
the referenced assets, at least some poor quality RMBS and CDO securities could be included in
each transaction to attract those investors.  When some of the high risk, poor quality loans later
incurred delinquencies or defaults, they caused losses, not in a single RMBS, but in multiple cash,
synthetic, and hybrid CDOs whose securities had been sold to a wide circle of investors.

1255

 

Conflicts of Interest.  Investment banks that designed, obtained credit ratings for,

1256

underwrote, sold, managed, and serviced CDO securities, made money from the fees they charged
for these and other services.  Investment banks reportedly netted from $5 to $10 million in fees
per CDO.
   Some also constructed CDOs to transfer the financial risk of poorly performing
RMBS and CDO securities from their own holdings to the investors they were soliciting to buy
the CDO securities.
not only from the CDO sales, but also eliminated possible losses from the assets removed from
their warehouse accounts.  In some instances, unbeknownst to the customers and investors, the
investment banks that sold them CDO securities bet against those instruments by taking short
positions through single name CDS contracts.  Some even took the short side of the CDO they

received nearly $5 million in fees for Gemstone 7, and the head of its CDO group said that Deutsche Bank received
typically between $5 and 10 million in fees, while Goldman Sachs charged a range of $5 to $30 million in fees for

constructed, and profited when the referenced assets lost value, and the investors to whom they
had sold the long side of the CDO were required to make substantial payments to the CDO.  

The following two case studies examine how two investment banks active in the U.S.

mortgage market constructed, marketed, and sold RMBS and CDO securities; how their activities
magnified risk in the mortgage market; and how conflicts of interest negatively impacted investors
and contributed to the financial crisis.  The Deutsche Bank case history provides an insider’s view
of what one senior CDO trader described as Wall Street’s “CDO machine.”  It reveals the trader’s
negative view of the mortgage market in general, the poor quality RMBS assets placed in a CDO
that Deutsche Bank marketed to clients, and the fees that made it difficult for investment banks
like Deutsche Bank to stop selling CDOs.  The Goldman Sachs case history shows how one
investment bank was able to profit from the collapse of the mortgage market, and ignored
substantial conflicts of interest to profit at the expense of its clients in the sale of RMBS and CDO
securities. 

 

B.  Running the CDO Machine:   
      Case Study of Deutsche Bank  
 
This case history examines the role of Deutsche Bank USA in the design, marketing, and 

sale of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that incorporated or referenced residential 
mortgage backed securities (RMBS).  

330 

 
From 2004 to 2008, U.S. financial institutions issued over $1.4 trillion worth of CDO 

securities.  At first, this complex structured finance product proved highly profitable for 
investment banks which established CDO departments and trading desks to create and market the 
securities.  By early 2007, however, due to declining housing prices, accelerating mortgage 
delinquencies, and RMBS losses, investor interest in CDOs began to drop off sharply.  In July 
2007, the major credit rating agencies began lowering credit ratings for many CDO securities, at 
times eliminating the investment grade ratings that had supported CDO sales.  Despite waning 
investor interest, U.S. investment banks continued to issue new mortgage related CDOs 
throughout 2007, in an apparent effort to sustain their fees and CDO departments.  Some 
investment banks supported the CDO market by purchasing existing CDO securities for 
inclusion in new, even more complex CDOs, seeking customers in Europe and Asia, or retaining 
risky CDO securities on their own books. 

 
Deutsche Bank was a major player in the CDO market, both in creating new CDO issues 

and trading these securities in the secondary market.  Deutsche Bank’s top global CDO trader, 
Greg Lippmann, began to express concerns that the CDO market was unsustainable.  By the 
middle of 2006, Mr. Lippmann repeatedly warned and advised his Deutsche Bank colleagues and 
some of his clients seeking to buy short positions about the poor quality of the assets underlying 
many CDOs.  He described some of those assets as “crap” and “pigs,” and predicted the assets 
and the CDO securities would lose value. 

 
At one point, Mr. Lippmann was asked to buy a specific CDO security and responded 

that it “rarely trades,” but he “would take it and try to dupe someone” into buying it.  He also at 
times referred to the industry’s ongoing CDO marketing efforts as a “CDO machine” or “ponzi 
scheme.” Deutsche Bank’s senior management disagreed with his negative views, and used the 
bank’s own funds to make large proprietary investments in mortgage related securities that, in 
2007, had a notional or face value of $128 billion and a market value of more than $25 billion.     
 

Despite disagreeing with his negative views on the mortgage market, Deutsche Bank 

allowed Mr. Lippmann, in 2005, to develop a large proprietary short position for the bank in the 
RMBS market.  Since carrying that short position required the bank to pay millions of dollars in 
premiums, senior management also required Mr. Lippmann to defray or eliminate those costs by 
convincing others to take short positions in the mortgage market, thereby generating fees for the 
bank from arranging those shorts.  In 2006, Mr. Lippmann generated an estimated $200 million 
in fees by encouraging his clients, such as hedge funds, to buy short positions.  Simultaneously, 
Mr. Lippmann increased the size of the bank’s short position by taking the short side of credit 
default swaps (CDS) referencing individual RMBS securities, an investment strategy often 

331 

   

To understand how Deutsche Bank continued to issue and market CDO securities even as 

 
referred to as investing in “single name CDS” contracts.  Over a two-year period from 2005 to 
2007, Mr. Lippmann built a massive short position in single name CDS contracts totaling $5 
billion.  From 2007 to 2008, at the direction of the bank’s senior management, he cashed in that 
position, generating a profit for his trading desk of approximately $1.5 billion, which he claims 
made more money on a single position than any other trade had ever made for Deutsche Bank in 
its history.  Despite that gain, due to its substantial long investments, Deutsche Bank incurred an 
overall loss of about $4.5 billion from its mortgage related proprietary investments.1258
 
 
the market for mortgage related securities began collapsing, the Subcommittee examined a 
specific CDO in detail, called Gemstone CDO VII Ltd. (Gemstone 7).  In October 2006, 
Deutsche Bank began assisting in the gathering of assets for Gemstone 7, which issued its 
securities in March 2007.   It was the last in a series of CDOs sponsored by HBK Capital 
Management (HBK), a large hedge fund which acted as the collateral manager for the CDO.  
Deutsche Bank made $4.7 million in fees from the deal, while HBK was slated to receive $3.3 
million.  It was not the last CDO issued by Deutsche Bank.  Even after Gemstone 7 was issued in 
March of 2007, Deutsche Bank issued 9 additional CDOs.     
 
 
RMBS securities initially valued at $1.1 billion when issued.  Deutsche Bank’s head global 
trader, Mr. Lippmann, recognized that these RMBS securities were high risk and likely to lose 
value, but did not object to their inclusion in Gemstone 7.  Deutsche Bank, the sole placement 
agent, marketed the initial offering of Gemstone 7 in the first quarter of 2007.  Its top tranches 
received AAA ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, despite signs that the CDO market 
was failing and the CDO itself contained many poor quality assets.   
 

Gemstone 7 was a hybrid CDO containing or referencing a variety of high risk, subprime 

Nearly a third of Gemstone’s assets consisted of high risk subprime loans originated by 
Fremont, Long Beach, and New Century, three lenders known at the time within the financial 
industry for issuing poor quality loans and RMBS securities.  Although HBK directed the 
selection of assets for Gemstone 7, Mr. Lippmann’s CDO Trading Desk was involved in the 
process and did not object to including certain RMBS securities in Gemstone 7, even though Mr. 
Lippmann was simultaneously referring to them as “crap” or “pigs.”  Mr. Lippmann was also at 
the same time advising some of his clients to short some of those same RMBS securities.  In 
addition, Deutsche Bank sold five RMBS securities directly from its inventory to Gemstone 7, 
several of which were also contemporaneously disparaged by Mr. Lippmann.   

 
The Deutsche Bank sales force aggressively sought purchasers for the CDO securities, 
while certain executives expressed concerns about the financial risk of retaining Gemstone 7 
assets as the market was deteriorating in early 2007.  In its struggle to sell Gemstone 7, Deutsche 
Bank motivated its sales force with special financial incentives, and sought out buyers in Europe 
and Asia because the U.S. market had dried up.  Deutsche Bank also talked of providing HBK’s 
marks, instead of its own, to clients asking about the value of Gemstone 7’s assets, since HBK’s

332 

 
marks showed the CDO’s assets performing better.  Deutsche Bank was ultimately unable to sell 
$400 million, or 36%, of the Gemstone 7 securities, and agreed with HBK to split the unsold 
securities, each taking $200 million onto its own books.   Deutsche Bank did not disclose to the 
eight investors whom it had solicited and convinced to buy Gemstone 7, that its global head 
trader of CDOs had an extremely negative view of a third of the assets in the CDO or that the 
bank’s internal valuations showed that the assets had lost over $19 million in value since 
purchased.1259

   

 
Gemstone 7 also demonstrated how CDOs magnified risk by including or referencing 

within itself 115 different RMBS securities containing thousands of high risk, poor quality 
subprime loans.  Many of those RMBS securities carried BB ratings, which are non-investment 
grade credit ratings and were among the highest risk securities in the CDO.  Gemstone 7 also 
included CDO securities that, in themselves, concentrated the risk of their underlying assets.  
Over 75% of Gemstone’s assets consisted of RMBS securities with ratings of BBB or lower, 
including approximately 33% with non-investment grade ratings, yet Gemstone’s top three 
tranches were given AAA ratings by the credit rating agencies.  The next three tranches were 
given investment grade ratings as well.  Those investment grade ratings enabled investors like 
pension funds, insurance companies, university endowments, and municipalities, some of which 
were required by law, regulation, or their investment plans to put their funds in safe investments, 
to consider buying Gemstone securities.  Eight investors actually purchased them.  Within eight 
months, the Gemstone securities began incurring rating downgrades.  By July 2008, all seven 
tranches in the CDO had been downgraded to junk status, and the long investors were almost 
completely wiped out.  Today, the Gemstone 7 securities are nearly worthless.   

 
Deutsche Bank was, in Mr. Lippmann’s words, part of a “CDO machine” run by 

investment banks that produced hundreds of billions of high risk CDO securities.  Because the 
fees to design and market CDOs ranged from $5 to $10 million per CDO, investment bankers 
had a strong financial incentive to continue issuing them, even in the face of waning investor 
interest and poor quality assets, since reduced CDO activity would have led to less income for 
structured finance units, smaller bonuses for executives, and even the disappearance of CDO 
departments, which is eventually what occurred.  The Deutsche Bank case history provides a 
cautionary tale for both market participants and regulators about how complex structured finance 
products gain advocates within an organization committed to pushing the products through the 
pipeline to maintain revenues and jobs, regardless of the financial risks or possible impact on the 
marketplace.

(1)  Subcommittee Investigation and Findings of Fact 

333 

As part of its investigation into the CDO market and the Deutsche Bank case study, the 

Subcommittee collected and reviewed hundreds of thousands of Deutsche Bank documents 
including reports, analyses, memoranda, correspondence, transcripts, spreadsheets, and email.  
The Subcommittee also collected and reviewed documents from HBK Capital Management, 
several financial institutions that purchased Deutsche Bank CDO securities, and the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC).  In addition, the Subcommittee conducted 14 interviews, 
including interviews with current and former Deutsche Bank and HBK executives, managers, 
sales representatives, and traders; spoke with personnel from the financial institutions that 
invested in Gemstone 7; and consulted with a number of experts from the SEC, academia, and 
industry.   

 

 

 

Based upon the Subcommittee’s review, the Report makes the following findings of fact. 

1.  CDO Machine.  From late 2006 through 2007, despite increasing mortgage 

delinquencies, RMBS losses, and investor flight from the U.S. mortgage market, U.S. 
investment banks continued to issue new CDOs, including Deutsche Bank which 
issued 15 new CDOs securitizing nearly $11.5 billion of primarily mortgage related 
assets from December 2006 to December 2007. 

 
2.  Fee Incentives.  Because the fees charged to design and market CDOs were in the 

range of $5 to $10 million per CDO, investment banks had strong incentives to 
continue issuing CDOs despite increasing risks and waning investor interest, since 
reduced CDO activity meant less revenues for structured finance units and even the 
disappearance of CDO departments and trading desks, which is eventually what 
occurred.   

 
3.  Deutsche Bank’s $5 Billion Short.  Although Deutsche Bank as a whole and through 

an affiliated hedge fund, Winchester Capital, made proprietary investments in long 
mortgage related assets, the bank also permitted its head CDO trader to make a $5 
billion short investment that bet against the mortgage market and produced bank 
profits totaling approximately $1.5 billion. 

 
4.   Proprietary Loss.  By 2007, Deutsche Bank, through its mortgage department and an 

affiliated hedge fund, had substantial proprietary holdings in the mortgage market, 
including more than $25 billion in long investments and a $5 billion short position, 
which together resulted in 2007 losses to the bank of about $4.5 billion. 

  
5.  Gemstone 7.  In the face of a deteriorating market, Deutsche Bank aggressively sold 
a $1.1 billion CDO, Gemstone 7, which included RMBS securities that the bank’s top 
CDO trader had disparaged as “crap” and “pigs,” and which produced $1.1 billion of 
high risk, poor quality securities that are now virtually worthless.

CDOs In General.  According to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets 

Association, $1.4 trillion worth of CDOs were issued in the United States from 2004 through the 
end of 2007.1260  The following chart depicts the dramatic rise and fall of the U.S. CDO market 
over the last ten years, with total CDO issuance reaching its peak in 2006 at $520 billion, and 
then falling to a low of $4 billion in 2009.1261

  

                                                   

In 2006 and 2007, investment banks created around half a trillion dollars in CDO 
securities each year, even as U.S. housing prices began to stagnate and decline, subprime 
mortgages began to default at record rates, and RMBS securities began to incur dramatic losses.  
By the middle of 2007, due to the increasing risks, U.S. institutional investors like pension funds, 
hedge funds, and others began to purchase fewer CDO securities, and investment banks turned 
their attention increasingly to European and Asian investors as well as the issuers of new CDOs 
who became the primary buyers of CDO securities.1262  In 2007, U.S. investment banks kept 
issuing and selling CDOs despite slowed sales, which meant that investment banks had to retain 
an increasing portion of the unsold assets on their own balance sheets.1263

The credit rating agencies marked a “sea change” in the CDO market in 2007, in which 
investment banks issued CDOs at near record levels in the first half of the year, but then sharply 
reined in their efforts after the mass rating downgrades of RMBS and CDO securities began in 
July 2007:  

“[The CDO] market in the U.S. was very active in terms of issuance throughout the first 
half of 2007. … The year 2007 saw a sea change for the CDO market.  Moody’s rated 
more than 100 SF [structured finance] CDO transactions in each of the first two quarters, 
but the number fell sharply to 40 in the third quarter and to just eight in the fourth quarter 
as the sheer speed and magnitude of the subprime mortgage fallout significantly 
weakened investors’ confidence.”1264

   

In the years leading up to the financial crisis, the typical size of a CDO deal was between 

1265 and generated large fees for investment banks in the range of $5 to $10 
  To handle these transactions, a number of large investment banks 

$1 and $1.5 billion,
million per CDO.1266
established CDO departments and trading desks charged with designing, underwriting, selling, or 
trading CDO securities.  The CDO origination desks typically worked with the investment 
banks’ structured finance sales force to sell the resulting CDO securities.  This structure meant 
that stopping the issuance of CDO securities would require the investment banks to lose out on 
the fees, prestige, and market share tied to CDO sales.  In addition, whole CDO departments, 
with their dedicated bankers, traders, and supervisors, would have to disappear, which is 
eventually what happened after the CDO market crashed.     

  

CDOs at Deutsche Bank.  From 2004 to 2008, Deutsche Bank issued 47 asset backed 

1267  According to analysts, in both 2006 and 
CDOs for a total securitization of $32.2 billion.
2007, Deutsche Bank ranked fourth globally in issuing asset backed CDOs, behind Merrill 
Lynch, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup.1268

bank that created it between $5 million and $10 million – about half of which usually ended up as employee 
bonuses.  Indeed, Wall Street awarded record bonuses in 2006, a hefty chunk of which came from the CDO 
business.”).  Fee information obtained by the Subcommittee is consistent with this range of CDO fees.  For example, 
Deutsche Bank received nearly $5 million in fees for Gemstone 7, and the head of its CDO Group said that Deutsche 
Bank received typically between $5 and 10 million in fees per CDO, while Goldman Sachs charged a range of $5 to 
$30 million in fees for its Camber 7, Fort Denison, and Hudson Mezzanine 1 and 2 CDOs. 12/20/2006 Gemstone 7

At Deutsche Bank, five different parts of the Securitized Product Group played key roles 

The CDO Group had two co-heads, Michael Lamont and Michael Herzig, and 

in its CDO business.  They were the CDO Group (North America); the CDO sales force, 
formally called Securitized Products; the CDO Syndication Desk which helped promote and 
track CDO sales; the mortgage department; and the CDO Trading Desk, formally called ABS 
(Asset Backed Security) Trading, CDO Trading, and ABS Correlation Trading.    
 
 
approximately 20 employees.  The heads of the group reported to Richard D’Albert, Global Head 
of Deutsche Bank’s Securitized Product Group.  The CDO Group designed and structured the 
bank’s CDOs, analyzed the assets that went into the CDOs, monitored the purchasing and 
warehousing of those assets, obtained CDO credit ratings, prepared CDO legal documentation, 
acted as the CDO underwriter or placement agent on behalf of Deutsche Bank, and oversaw the 
issuance of the CDO securities.1269
 

The CDO sales force sold the resulting CDO securities for Deutsche Bank.  It received 
assistance from the CDO Syndication, sometimes called the “syndicate,” which helped promote 
the deals with investors and tracked CDO sales.  The CDO sales force was headed by Sean 
Whelan and Michael Jones.  They reported to Munir D’auhajre, overall head of sales, who 
reported, in turn, to Fred Brettschneider, the head of the Institutional Client Group of Deutsche 
Bank Americas.  The CDO sales force had approximately 20 employees.  In the United States, 
the CDO Syndication had about seven employees, and was headed by Anthony Pawlowski, who 
reported to Mr. Lamont and Mr. Herzig, who headed the CDO Group. 
 

  

 

The Deutsche Bank mortgage department was responsible for purchasing residential 

mortgages from a variety of sources, warehousing those mortgages, and securitizing the 
mortgages into RMBS securities for which Deutsche Bank acted as the underwriter or placement 
agent.  Some of those RMBS securities were later included or referenced in CDOs issued by the 
bank.    
 

The CDO Trading Desk was headed by Greg Lippmann, who served as global head of 

Deutsche Bank’s CDO, ABS, and ABS Correlation Trading Desks.1270  Those desks were 
responsible for trading a variety of RMBS, CDO, and other asset backed securities on the 
secondary market.  Mr. Lippmann had a staff of approximately 30 employees, 20 in the United 
States and 10 in London.  Like the head of the CDO Group, Mr. Lippmann reported to Mr. 
D’Albert, the head of the bank’s Securitized Product Group.  Mr. Lippmann was also the head of 
risk management for all new issue CDOs and described himself as “involved in underwriting, 
structuring, marketing and hedging our warehouse risk for new issue cdos.”1271

The CDO Trading Desk conducted trades for both clients and other Deutsche Bank 

entities.  It was further divided into three trading desks, designated the CDO, ABS, and ABS 
Correlation Desks.  Each traded certain structured finance products, tracked relevant market 
news and developed expertise in its assigned products, and served as a source of asset and 
market information for other branches of Deutsche Bank.  The CDO Desk focused on buying and 
selling CDO securities; the ABS Desk concentrated on trading RMBS and other asset backed 
securities as well as short trading strategies involving credit default swap (CDS) contracts in 
single name RMBS; and the ABS Correlation Desk acted primarily in a market making capacity 
for Deutsche Bank clients, trading both long and short RMBS and CDO securities and CDS 
contracts with the objective of taking offsetting positions that minimized the bank’s risk.1272
 
 
Deutsche Bank in 2000, after a stint at Credit Suisse trading bonds.  One publication noted that 
Mr. Lippmann “made his name with big bets on a housing bust,” continuing:  “Mr. Lippmann 
emerged as a Cassandra of the financial crisis, spotting cracks in the mortgage market as early as 
2006.  His warnings helped Deutsche brace for the crisis. He also helped investors – and himself  
– land huge profits as big bets that the housing market would collapse materialized.”1273
   

Mr. Lippmann was well known in the CDO marketplace as a trader.  He had joined 

   

 

(3)  Deutsche Bank’s $5 Billion Short  

In 2006 and 2007, Deutsche Bank’s top CDO trader, Greg Lippmann, repeatedly warned 
his Deutsche Bank colleagues and some clients outside of the bank about the poor quality of the 
assets underlying many RMBS and CDO securities.   Although senior management within the 
bank did not agree with his views, they allowed Mr. Lippmann, in 2005, to establish a large short 
position on behalf of the bank, essentially betting that mortgage related securities would fall in 
value.  From 2005 to 2007, Mr. Lippmann built that position into a $5 billion short.   

 

 

 

(a) Lippmann’s Negative Views of Mortgage Related Assets 

Emails produced to the Subcommittee provide repeated examples of Mr. Lippmann’s 

negative views of mortgage related assets, particularly those involving subprime mortgages.  At 
times, he expressed his views to colleagues within the bank; at other times he expressed them in 
connection with advising a client to bet against an RMBS security by taking a short position.  At 
times, Mr. Lippmann recommended that his clients short poor quality RMBS assets, even while 
his trading desk was participating in a selection process that included those same assets in 
Gemstone 7.  The following emails by Mr. Lippmann, written during 2006 and 2007, provide 
examples of his negative views.

When asked about these emails, Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that he generally 
thought all assets in CDOs were weak, and that his descriptions were often a form of posturing 
while negotiating prices with his clients.  In a number of cases, however, Mr. Lippmann was 
assisting his clients in devising short strategies or communicating with Deutsche Bank 
colleagues, rather than negotiating with clients over prices.  As will be seen later in this Report, 
some of the RMBS securities he criticized were, at virtually the same time, being included by his 
trading desk in Gemstone 7, which was later sold by Deutsche Bank’s CDO Group.   

 
In addition to disparaging individual RMBS securities, Mr. Lippmann expressed repeated 
negative views about the CDO market as a whole.  At times during 2006 and 2007, he referred to 
CDO underwriting activity by investment banks as the workings of a “CDO machine” or “ponzi 
scheme.”1288  In June 2006, for example, a year before CDO credit ratings began to be 
downgraded en masse, Mr. Lippmann sent an email to a hedge fund trader warning about the 
state of the CDO market: “[S]tuff is flat b/c [because] the cdo machine has not slowed but I am 
fielding 2-4 new guys a day that are kicking the tires so we probably don’t go tighter.” 1289  A 
few months later, in August 2006, Mr. Lippmann wrote about the coming market crash:  “I don’t 
care what some trained seal bull market research person says this stuff has a real chance of 
massively blowing up.”1290
 

  

When asked about his comments, Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that the CDO 

  Mr. Lippmann also told the Subcommittee that while he knew that the 

market was not really a ponzi scheme, because people did receive an investment return, and 
asserted that he had used the term because he was “grasping at things” to prove he was right in 
his short position.1291
major credit rating agencies had given AAA ratings to an unusually large number of RMBS and 
CDO securities and most people believed in the ratings, he did not.  He also told the

Subcommittee that he “told his views to anyone who would listen” but most CDO investors  
disagreed with him.1292

   

 
In March 2007, Mr. Lippmann again expressed his view that mortgage related assets 

were “blowing up”: 

 
“I remain firm in my belief that these are blowing up whether people like it or not and 
that hpa [housing price appreciation] is far less relevant than these bulls think.  Can’t 
blame them because if this blows up lots of people lose their jobs so they must deny in 
hope that that will help prevent the collapse.  At this price I’m nearly just as short as I’ve 
ever been.”1293

  

(b) Building and Cashing in the $5 Billion Short 

 

 

Mr. Lippmann did not just express negative views of RMBS and CDO securities to his 
colleagues and clients, he also acquired a significant short position on those assets on behalf of 
Deutsche Bank.  Despite the views of virtually all other senior executives at the bank that RMBS 
and CDO securities would gain in value over time, Mr. Lippmann convinced the bank to allow 
him to initiate and build a substantial proprietary short position that would pay off only if 
mortgage related securities lost value.    

 
 
Initiating the Short Position.  In 2005, Deutsche Bank was heavily invested in the U.S. 
mortgage market and, by 2007, had accumulated a long position in mortgage related assets that, 
according to Deutsche Bank, had a notional or face value of $128 billion and a market value of 
more than $25 billion.1294  These positions had been accumulated and were held primarily by the 
Deutsche Bank mortgage department, the ABS Trading Desk, and a Deutsche Bank affiliated 
hedge fund, Winchester Capital, which was based in London.1295
 

   

Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that, despite the bank’s positive view of the 

mortgage market, in the fall of 2005, he requested permission to establish a proprietary trading

On June 23, 2007, Mr. Lippmann wrote to a Deutsche Bank colleague, “Yup this is the beginning of phase 2 (the 
bulls still can’t see it), sales by the longs and how do you think the foreign banks will feel when they see that the 
true mark for what they have is … this could be the end of the cdo biz.”  6/23/2007 email from Greg Lippmann to 
Michael George, DBSI_PSI_EMAIL02584591.   
1294 According to Deutsche Bank, as of March 31, 2007, it held a total long position in mortgage related securities 
whose notional or face value totaled $127.8 billion, including $4.3 billion at “ABS Correlation London”; $5 billion 
at “CDO Primary Issue/New York”; $102 billion at “RMBS/New York”; $7.6 billion at “SPG-Asset Finance/New 
York”; and $8.9 billion at “Winchester Capital/London.”  3/2/2011 letter from Deutsche Bank’s counsel to the 
Subcommittee, PSI-DeutscheBank-31-0004-06.  The market value of those positions was substantially lower.  For 
example, according to Deutsche Bank, the $102 billion long investment held by its RMBS/New York office had a 
market value of about $24 billion.  3/21/2011 letter from Deutsche Bank’s counsel to the Subcommittee, PSI-

position that would short RMBS securities.1296  He explained that he made this request after 
reviewing data he received from a Deutsche Bank quantitative analyst, Eugene Xu.  He said that 
this data showed that, in regions of the United States where housing prices had increased by 
13%, the default rates for subprime mortgages had increased to 7%.1297  At the same time, he 
said, in other regions where housing prices had increased only 4%, the subprime mortgage 
default rates had quadrupled to 28%.1298  Mr. Lippmann explained that he had concluded that 
even a moderate slow down in rising housing prices would result in significant subprime 
mortgage defaults, that there was considerable correlation among these subprime mortgages, and 
that the defaults would affect BBB rated RMBS securities.  Mr. Lippmann stressed that his 
negative view of RMBS securities was based primarily on his view that moderating home prices 
would cause subprime mortgage defaults and was not dependent upon the quality of the 
subprime loans.1299

   

 
In the fall of 2005, Mr. Lippmann said that he approached his supervisor Richard 

D’Albert, Global Head of the Structured Products Group, for permission to enter into CDS 
agreements to short RMBS securities totaling $1 billion.1300
that a cost benefit analysis favored a short RMBS position, because the bank would pay a 
relatively small amount of CDS premiums per year in exchange for a potentially huge payout.  
Mr. Lippmann said that he estimated at the time that, when the costs were compared to the 
potential payout if the BBB securities defaulted, the proposed short position offered a potential 
payout ratio of 8 to 1. 

 He said that he explained at the time 

 
Mr. Lippmann also developed a presentation supporting his position entitled, “Shorting 

Home Equity Mezzanine Tranches.”  It made the following points: 

 
•  “Over 50% of outstanding subprime mortgages are located in MSAs [metropolitan 

statistical areas] with double digit 5 year average of annual home price growth rates. 

 
•  There is a strong negative correlation between home price appreciation and loss 

 
•  Default of subprime mortgages are also strongly negatively correlated with home 

severity.

investment by the bank, Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that it was.  Id.  Deutsche Bank acknowledges in a 
20-F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it conducts proprietary trading, in addition to

its capital) to exploit market opportunities.  See Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft’s Form 20-F filed with the

become popular.” 1301

   

 

Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that Mr. D’Albert approved his taking the short 
position in or around November 2005, but said the trade was so big and controversial that Mr. 
Lippmann also had to get the approval of Rajeev Misra, Global Head of Credit Trading, 
Securitization and Commodities, who was based in London.1302
around November 2005, Mr. Misra reluctantly gave his approval for the short position, even 
though Mr. Misra believed mortgage related securities would continue to increase in value over 
time.

Building the Short Position.  Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that he used some 

Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that he spent much of 2006 pitching his clients to 

 
existing short positions that had been undertaken as hedges to begin building his position.1303  He 
said that, throughout 2006, he gradually accumulated a larger short position, which eventually 
reached $2 billion.  According to Mr. Lippmann, Deutsche Bank senior management reluctantly 
went along.1304  He told the Subcommittee that, at one point in 2006, Boaz Weinstein, who 
reported to Mr. Misra, told him that the carrying costs of his position, which required the bank to 
pay insurance-like premiums to support the $2 billion short position, had become so large that he 
had to find a way to pay for them.  According to Mr. Lippmann, the bank’s senior management 
asked him to persuade them that he was right by demonstrating that others were willing to 
“short” the market as well.  Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee he was then motivated to 
convince his clients that they ought to short the mortgage market, arrange the shorts for them, 
and make enough in fees from those transactions to pay for the costs of his multi-billion-dollar 
short.1305
 
 
short the mortgage market.  He said that he often made presentations to prospective clients 
sharing with them his “strategy on how to cash in on a slowing housing market.”1306  He said 
that, in early 2006, he expended approximately 200 hours trying to convince AIG to short single 
name RMBS, but was unsuccessful.  He told the Subcommittee that he also believed that his 
presentations helped convince AIG to stop buying RMBS and CDO securities and stop selling 
CDS protection for those deals.  In an August 2006 email, Mr. Lippmann wrote:  “In 05 for a 
time, we sold EVERY single one to AIG.  They stepped out of the market in March of 06 after 
speaking with me and our research people (and I don’t doubt other dealers).”1307

told the Subcommittee that Mr. Lamont, who co-led Deutsche Bank’s CDO Group, was not 
pleased that Mr. Lippmann had convinced AIG, a very large purchaser of long interest in RMBS 
and CDO securities, to stop buying them.   
 

The documents indicate that Mr. Lippmann and his trading team were aware at the time 

that the CDO Trading Desk was expected to promote rather than discourage client interest in 
purchasing Deutsche Bank’s CDO securities.  One of Mr. Lippmann’s top traders, Rocky Kurita, 
put it this way in mid-2005:  “[W]e have to make money.  Customer happiness is a secondary 
goal but we cannot lose sight of the trading desk[’]s other role of supporting new issue and the 
customer franchise.”1308  In a 2007 email to a client, Mr. Lippmann wrote:  “[P]lease please do 
not forward these emails outside of your firm. … I do not want to be blamed by the new issue 
people for destroying their business.”1309
 
 
securities, he did convince some of his other clients, usually hedge funds, to undertake such 
shorts, primarily by purchasing single name CDS contracts referencing specific RMBS 
securities.  Those trades generated substantial sums for the ABS Correlation Trading Desk which 
acted as a market maker in the CDS market for those clients.  Mr. Lippmann told the 
Subcommittee that the shorts executed by his clients ultimately generated about $200 million in 
revenues for his desk in 2006.1310

Although Mr. Lippmann was unsuccessful in convincing AIG to short RMBS and CDO 

    

   

 

Defending the Short.  According to Mr. Lippmann, in December 2006, he met in 

London with a senior bank official, Anshu Jain, Head of Global Markets at Deutsche Bank, and 
suggested that Deutsche Bank’s long positions in mortgage related securities created too much 
exposure for the bank and should be reduced.1311
  Mr. Lippmann recommended that the bank 
hedge its risk using his short strategy.  His suggestion was not acted upon, but as the market 
grew more volatile in late 2006 and early 2007, Mr. Lippmann’s short position began to gain in 
value and caught the attention of senior management at the bank. 

 
Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that, in January 2007, he met with Mr. Jain, Mr. 

Misra, and Mr. D’Albert at a hotel in Lisbon, where all three again challenged him to defend his 
short position by noting that it had required him to pay out $20 million in CDS premiums during 
2006.1312  Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that he countered by pointing out, while he had 
paid out $20 million, his desk made $200 million from trading in RMBS and CDO shorts for his 
clients.  He said that the three concluded he could keep his short position.1313
  According to Mr. 
Lippmann, in February 2007, Mr. Jain met with him again to discuss whether or not to keep his 
short position, because it had gained in value and Deutsche Bank could cash in the position and

take the profits at that time.  Mr. Lippmann said that the result of the meeting was that, once 
again, his position was left in place.   

 
While defending his position within the bank, Mr. Lippmann continued to speak with his 

outside clients about his negative views of the market, continued to make presentations to 
potential clients about shorting the market,1314
building his desk’s proprietary short position. 

 and continued to execute shorts for them, while 

 
According to Mr. Lippmann, in late February or early March 2007, as the ABX Index 
showed subprime RMBS securities losing value and subprime mortgages continued incurring 
delinquencies at record rates, an ad hoc meeting of Deutsche Bank’s executive committee took 
place in London to discuss the bank’s risk exposure in mortgage related securities.  According to 
Mr. Lippmann, he happened to be in London at the time and was invited to attend.  He estimated 
that ten to twelve persons were at the meeting in person, and another two to four persons 
participated by telephone.  He said that, at the meeting, Deutsche Bank executives discussed 
whether the recent market volatility reflected short term or longer term trends and whether the 
bank should make any changes in its holdings.1315  At that time, Mr. Lippmann held the only 
large short position on behalf of the bank, then about $4 to 5 billion in size.1316  In contrast, the 
Deutsche Bank mortgage group held $102 billion in long RMBS and CDO securities, and 
Winchester Capital, Deutsche Bank’s hedge fund affiliate, held a net long position of $8.9 
billion.1317  Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that he was the only person at the meeting who 
argued for the bank to increase its short position.1318

 
At the time of the London meeting, Mr. Lippmann’s position was showing a significant 
profit.  Mr. Misra brought up the alternative of cashing in his position while RMBS prices were 
down, because he thought prices were in a short term dip and the profits might disappear later 
on.  Mr. Lippmann contended that the bank should not only keep his short position, but increase 
it, but more senior voices disagreed with him.  He told the Subcommittee that the decision at the 
end of the meeting was for all parties to keep their positions unchanged, including Mr. 
Lippmann.1319

   

 

 
Cashing In the Short.  In July 2007, the major credit rating agencies began issuing 

downgrades of RMBS and CDO securities, in particular those that incorporated or referenced 
subprime mortgages.  The value of those securities began to plummet.  By the end of the summer 
of 2007, Deutsche Bank initiated efforts to sell off the long positions held by Winchester Capital 
and other Deutsche Bank entities, reflecting a shift in the bank’s strategy, but its sales force had

difficulty due to the lack of customers willing to buy long.1320   During 2007 and 2008, at the 
direction of senior management, Mr. Lippmann gradually cashed in his short position, obtaining 
a total return of about $1.5 billion, which Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee he believes was 
the largest profit obtained from a single position in Deutsche Bank history.1321

   

 
Despite the gain from Mr. Lippmann’s short position, Deutsche Bank told the 

Subcommittee that, overall in 2007, it had a long position in mortgage related holdings, with a 
face value of about $128 billion and a market value of more than $25 billion.  Deutsche Bank 
told the Subcommittee that, despite the size of these holdings and their declining value, it lost 
only about $4.5 billion on those mortgage related holdings for the year.1322  Deutsche Bank also 
filed a 2007 annual report with the SEC claiming a 2007 profit of €7.2 billion.1323  When asked 
why its large long position in mortgage holdings did not lose more value, Deutsche Bank told the 
Subcommittee that it had placed large hedges, using U.S. Treasury bonds, which reduced its 
losses.1324

 

 
(4) The “CDO Machine”  

 

From 2006 to 2007, Mr. Lippmann repeatedly cautioned his colleagues and clients that 

the mortgage market was headed for a downfall, convinced a number of his clients to short 
RMBS and CDO securities, and built his $5 billion short position on behalf of Deutsche Bank.  
Meanwhile, the “CDO machine,” as he described it, continued issuing new CDO securities 
through the end of 2007.  The reasons for this continuing CDO activity, despite a deteriorating 
mortgage market and waning investor interest, are key to understanding how these complex, high 
risk, structured finance products ended up in multiple financial portfolios throughout the U.S. 
financial system. 

 
Mr. Lippmann was frequently asked why, given his negative views, the CDO market was 
continuing to operate.  He pointed to investment bank fees, prestige, and pressure to preserve the 
CDO jobs involved.  In August 2006, for example, Mr. Lippmann wrote:  
                                                 
1320 Subcommittee interview of Jordan Milman (10/22/2010).  Mr. Milman, one of Mr. Lippmann’s top traders, 
stated that the market first weakened in February 2007, stabilized until June or July 2007, and then it was a “one 
way train” down from then through 2008.  Id.

1322 According to a chart prepared by Deutsche Bank for the Subcommittee, in 2007 and 2008, its RMBS holdings 
lost about $3.4 billion; the CDO Group lost about $1.0 billion; Winchester Capital lost about $1.1 billion; and two 
other trading desks lost nearly $650 million.  These losses were offset by the $1.5 billion gain from the bank’s short 
position, for total mortgage related losses of about $4.5 billion.  Net Revenues from ABS Products Backed by U.S.

1323 Deutsche Bank stated in its annual report filed with the SEC that it ended 2007 in the black, due to gains in other 
areas of the bank, including its Corporate and Investment Bank which reported a pre-tax profit of €5.1 billion and its 
Private Clients and Asset Management division which reported a pre-tax profit of €2.1 billion.  See Deutsche Bank’s

“Why have we done this?  It is not without reluctance and we are looking for ways to get 
out of this risk, but for now the view has been, we like the fees and the league table credit 
(and dammit we have a budget to make).”1325
  

  

In January 2007, after a trader asked Mr. Lippmann why the CDO market hadn’t imploded, Mr. 
Lippmann responded:  “league table, fees, never has one blown up yet.”1326  The reference to 
“league table credit” indicates that investment banks considered it prestigious to be listed as the 
leading producer of a complex structured finance product like CDOs, and used their standing in 
the tables that tracked total origination numbers as a way of burnishing their reputations, 
attracting top talent, and generating new business.  An October 2006 “Progress Report” on its 
CDO business, for example, which was prepared internally by the bank, included a slide entitled, 
“CDO Primary Revenue Forecast and League Tables,” in which a chart ranked Deutsche Bank 
third in CDO issuance, behind Merrill Lynch and Citigroup.1327
  The slide indicated that 
Deutsche Bank had completed 38 CDOs to date, had a 7% share of the CDO market, and 
“expected to close 50 deals by year end,” with the “pipeline for Q1 and Q2 2007 building.”  The 
final page of the presentation, providing a chart listing the top 20 Deutsche Bank CDO 
salespersons by region, together with their individual sales credits, identifies some of the bank 
personnel invested in the continuation of the CDO business. 
 

On the issue of fees, the head of Deutsche Bank’s CDO Group Michael Lamont told the 

Subcommittee that he estimated the bank received 40-200 basis points for each CDO created, 
depending upon the complexity of the CDO.1328  He indicated those fees translated into about $5 
to $10 million per CDO.1329  When asked what he meant by saying “we have a budget to make,” 
Mr. Lippmann explained that new CDO deals had to be completed continuously to produce the 
revenues needed to support the budgets of the CDO desks and departments involved with their 
creation.1330

A similar view as to why the CDO business continued to operate despite increasing 

market risk was expressed by a former executive at the hedge fund Paulson & Co. in a January 
2007 email exchange with another investor.  The Paulson executive wrote:  
 

 “It is true that the market is not pricing the subprime RMBS wipeout scenario.  In my 
opinion this situation is due to the fact that rating agencies, CDO managers and 
underwriters have all the incentives to keep the game going, while ‘real money’ investors 
have neither the analytic tools nor the institutional framework to take action before the 
losses that one could anticipate based [on] the ‘news’ available everywhere are actually 
realized.”1331

 

At the end of September 2006, the head of Deutsche Bank’s sales force, Sean Whelan, 
wrote to Mr. Lippmann expressing concern that some CDO tranches were getting increasingly 
1332  Mr. 
difficult to sell:  “[T]he equity and the AAA were the parts we found difficult to place.”
Lippmann told the Subcommittee that once firms could not sell an entire CDO to investors, it 
was a warning that the market was waning, and the investment banks should have stopped 
structuring new ones.1333
source of CDO demand was found – when new CDOs started buying old CDO securities to 
include in their assets.  One media report explained how this worked: 

  Instead of getting out of the CDO business, however, he said, a new 

“As the housing boom began to slow in mid-2006, investors became skittish about the 
riskier parts of those investments.  So the banks created – and ultimately provided most 
of the money for – new CDOs.  Those new CDOs bought the hard-to-sell pieces of the 
original CDOs.  The result was 
Each new CDO had its own risky pieces.  Banks created yet other CDOs to buy 
those.”1334

a daisy chain that solved one problem but created another: 

 

Research conducted by Thetica Systems, at the request of ProPublica, found that in the 

last years before the financial crisis, CDOs had become the dominant purchaser of high risk 
CDO securities, largely replacing real money investors like pension funds, insurance companies, 
and hedge funds.  The CDO market analysis found that, by 2007, 67% of the high risk mezzanine 
CDO securities had been purchased by other CDOs, up from 36% in 2004.

could not sell all of its CDO securities.  He reported that he told Mr. Lamont that defaults would increase.

Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that he considered it a “shady” practice when, in

email to Mr. Lippmann, Richard Kim, a Deutsche Bank Managing Director, described placing 
unsold CDO tranches into a new CDO to be sold to investors as a “CDO2 balance sheet 
dump.”1337

   

In addition to placing unsold CDO securities in newly issued CDOs, investment banks 

turned increasingly to non-U.S. investors to keep the CDO machine going.  In August 2006, Mr. 
Lippmann noted that European and Asian banks were being targeted to buy CDOs:   

  
“Hear what you are saying and in a normal market your logic would be inarguable, but 
the demand for this crap is virtually entirely technically driven, all cdos.  And each 
person at the cdo table thinks someone else is the fool- cdo equity, ostensibly only two 
buyers one mutual fund in Australia, and one hedge fund in Chicago, who is actually 
putting on a bearish correlation trade:  bbb sold mostly ponzi-like to other cdos with 
limited distribution in Europe.  AA and Junior AAA sold mostly to high grade cdos and 
to a certain extent European and Asian banks and lastly the senior AAA, this may 
ultimately break the cdo market.”1338

   

 
In a December 2006 email, Mr. Lippmann wrote to a client: “[W]ho owns the cdos…insurance 
company and german and asian banks…and high grade cdos (can you say ponzi scheme)[?]”1339
In early 2007, he wrote: 
 

  

 “[T]he other side is all cdos..so it is the cdo investors who r on the other side who buys 
cdos:  aaa-reinsurance, ws [Wall Street] conduits, European and Asian banks, aa-high 
grade cdos, European and Asian banks and insurers..some US insurers, bbb other mezz 
[mezzanine] abs [asset-backed security] cdos (i.e. ponzi scheme), European banks and 
insurers, equity some US hedge funds, Asian insurance companies, Australian and 
Japanese retail investors through mutual funds.” 1340

 

 

In February 2007, when an investor wrote to Mr. Lippmann inquiring about the status of 

the “CDO machine,” Mr. Lippmann responded:  “[G]etting slower but not dead yet[.]  …  2-5 
ramping a day instead of 10-15[.]  …  [H]earing of many investors in [A]sia especially shutting 
down … but the window is not completely shut yet.”1341  Deutsche Bank emails demonstrate 
that, in 2007, like other investment banks, it was actively trying to sell CDOs in Asia.1342

Mr. Lippmann had an unrelentingly negative view of the RMBS and CDO securities he 
traded.  He believed the securities would ultimately lose value, but he also believed investment 
banks would do all they could to sustain the CDO market for as long as possible due to the CDO 
fees, prestige, market share, and jobs at stake.   
 

(5)  Gemstone    

350 

To understand how one investment bank, Deutsche Bank, continued to develop and 

 
 
aggressively solicit its clients to purchase CDO securities even as mortgage related securities lost 
value and the CDO market began collapsing, the Subcommittee examined in detail Gemstone 7, 
a $1.1 billion CDO.  Gemstone 7 was assembled and marketed by Deutsche Bank, as sole 
placement agent, from October 2006 to March 2007.1343  Gemstone 7 was the last in a series of 
CDOs sponsored by HBK Capital Management (HBK), a large hedge fund.1344

   

   
Deutsche Bank issued the Gemstone 7 securities in March 2007.  Six out of Gemstone’s 

seven tranches received investment grade ratings, including AAA ratings for the top three 
tranches.  Two months later, in July 2007, the major credit rating agencies issued mass rating 
downgrades of RMBS and CDO securities, including 19 of the 115 RMBS securities included or 
referenced in Gemstone 7.  In November 2007, the credit rating agencies began to downgrade the 
Gemstone 7 securities.  Today, all seven tranches have been downgraded to junk status, and the 
Gemstone 7 securities are nearly worthless. 

  
(a) Background on Gemstone  
 
Gemstone 7 was a $1.1 billion hybrid CDO whose assets consisted predominantly of high 

risk subprime RMBS securities. Nearly 90% of its assets were mid and subprime RMBS 
securities with 33% carrying non-investment grade ratings.1345  Of the remaining assets, 4.5% 
were CDO securities; 3.3% were commercial mortgage backed securities; and 3.5% were 
securities backed by pools of student loans.1346   When the deal closed in March 2007, Gemstone 
7 had about $476 million in cash RMBS assets as well as $625 million in synthetic assets.1347
  
Gemstone 7 was constructed as a “partially static” CDO, meaning that while some of its assets 
were set and could not change, others could be replaced by the collateral manager, HBK.   

                                                 
1343 In the Gemstone 7 offering circular, Deutsche Bank is described as the placement agent:  “The Notes purchased 
by the Initial Purchaser, if any, will be privately placed with eligible investors by the Initial Purchaser” where the 
Initial Purchaser was Deutsche Bank.  Gemstone 7 Offering Circular, GEM7-00000427-816 at GEM7-00000640.  In 
contrast, other documents produced by Deutsche Bank indicate that the bank was acting as an underwriter in the 
Gemstone 7 transaction.  See, e.g., 12/20/2006 Gemstone 7 Securitization Credit Report, DB_PSI_00237655-71 and 
undated Gemstone 7 Securitization Credit Report, MTSS000011-13.  For ease of reference but without making a 
judgment on the matter, this Report uses the term “placement agent” when describing Deutsche Bank’s role in 
Gemstone 7.

HBK is a Dallas based hedge fund that was founded in October 1991, and by 2007, 

managed approximately $12 billion in capital.1348  According to HBK, its Structured Products 
Group, one of its 21 business units, was “one of the leading purchasers and long-term investors 
in credit sensitive mortgages … including RMBS and ABS, a component in HBK’s overall 
strategy since 2002.”1349  Deutsche Bank told the Subcommittee that HBK had a reputation as a 
competent manager of mortgage related assets.1350
  HBK had acted as the collateral manager for 
seven previous CDO deals (six named Gemstone), choosing to alternate the mandate for the 
deals between Lehman Brothers and Deutsche Bank.   

 
In October 2006, HBK retained Deutsche Bank to act as the placement agent for 

Gemstone 7.   Under the agreement, HBK was to receive 30 basis points, or 0.3%, per year of the 
notional amount of Gemstone 7 (approximately $3.3 million) in return for serving as the 
collateral manager.  Deutsche Bank was slated to receive $6.79 million in “underwriting fees,” 
but because the deal did not sell completely, Deutsche Bank ultimately received a lesser amount 
of $4.7 million.1351
   

On October 25, 2006, HBK and Deutsche Bank signed an agreement outlining the terms 

   

351 

of Gemstone 7.  HBK told the Subcommittee: 

 
“The collateral purchased under the warehouse arrangement was selected by HBK and 
subject to Deutsche Bank’s right of approval.  The warehouse documents originally 
contemplated a total collateral pool of $750 million, which was increased to $1.1 billion 
in late December 2006.”1352
 

   

On October 24, 2006, Deutsche Bank opened a warehouse account to store the assets that would 
serve as the collateral for the CDO when it closed.1353
 Deutsche Bank and HBK shared the risk

Securitization Credit Report, MTSS000011-13; 3/15/2007 Gemstone CDO VII Ltd. Closing Memorandum, 
DB_PSI_00133536-41.  According to the Gemstone Offering Circular, HBK was to receive “0.30% per annum on 
the Quarterly Amount payable in arrears on each distribution date.”  3/15/2007 Offering Circular for Gemstone 
CDO VII, Ltd., GEM7-00000427-816, “The Management Agreement,” at 168.  As opposed to an upfront fee, which 
Deutsche Bank received, the fee to HBK was paid quarterly.  Thus, 0.30% of $1.1 billion translates to a fee of 
approximately $3.3 million for HBK.  See 7/11/2007 email from Chehao Lu at Deutsche Bank to Marco Lukesch at 
HBK, GEM7-00003568.  See also email noting HBK’s quarterly collateral management fee of $826,067.88 as of

1353 See chart, “Assets Purchased by Gemstone VII CDO during Warehouse Period,” GEM7-00001831-33 (showing 
assets purchased during the warehouse period).  According to Credit magazine, “The financial press will often make 
its first mention of a ‘new’ CDO on or around the time of its closing – with the closing date generally the day on 
which the CDO issues tranches of debt and equity to investors.  Prior to that day, however, there will have been a so-
called pre-closing or ‘warehousing’ period, typically lasting between three and six months.  During that period the 
asset manager will have acquired (or ‘warehoused’) assets to act as collateral for the securities to be issued by the 
CDO … on the closing day.”  See “CDO Guide: recovery rates,” Credit magazine (May 2004),

for any change in value of the warehoused assets if the deal failed to close.  Pursuant to the risk 
sharing agreement, if the deal failed to close, HBK would incur the risk for the first $80 million 
in losses, and Deutsche Bank would bear the remaining risk.1354

 
Deutsche Bank CDO Group.  Several departments and desks at Deutsche Bank were 
involved in designing, marketing, and selling the Gemstone 7 securities.  The CDO Group, co-
headed by Michael Lamont and Michael Herzig, was responsible for designing its structure, 
monitoring the purchasing and warehousing of its assets, obtaining its credit ratings, preparing 
the legal documentation, establishing its administrative structure, obtaining underwriting 
approval of the deal, designing the marketing materials, and overseeing the issuance of the CDO 
securities.1355  Abhayad Kamat within the CDO Group was assigned lead responsibility for 
structuring Gemstone 7.1356
the CDO approval process once HBK selected assets.  The CDO sales force, headed by Sean 
Whelan and Michael Jones, was responsible for selling the Gemstone 7 CDO securities.   

  The CDO Trading Desk, headed by Greg Lippmann, participated in 

   
To issue the CDO securities, Deutsche Bank established an offshore corporation in the 
Cayman Islands called Gemstone CDO VII, Ltd.1357  To administer the corporation, Deutsche 
Bank appointed its Cayman Island affiliate, Deutsche Bank Cayman, which is a licensed trust 
company.1358  As administrator, Deutsche Bank Cayman provided Gemstone 7 with the 
administrative services needed to operate the CDO securitization, including but not limited to, 
providing office facilities and secretarial staff, maintaining the books and records required by 
Cayman law, naming at least two Cayman directors, and acting as the Share Registrar for 
Gemstone shares.1359

1360 An equity tranche is the tranche in an RMBS or CDO structure that is designed to be the first to incur any losses 
from the securitization.  Since it is expected to incur at least some level of losses, the equity tranche is usually not 
given a credit rating and is often retained by the originator of the securitization.  See American Banker definition, 
http://www.americanbanker.com/glossary/e.html. 
1361  According to HBK, “HBK’s investment process integrates expertise in capital markets, structural analysis, 
collateral and loan level analysis, due diligence, and in house surveillance.  HBK is seen as not as a trader but as a 

353 

 
from CDO transactions resulting in strong alignment of interests between HBK and 
investors.”1362  According to Kevin Jenks, HBK’s collateral manager, HBK had a “buy and hold” 
approach to all of its Gemstone CDOs.1363  HBK also told the Subcommittee that it participated 
in Gemstone 7 with “the objective of obtaining long exposure to the CDO’s collateral, on a 
leveraged basis, through ownership of the Residual interest.”1364

  

 
HBK deals were known for containing above average concentrations of BB or lower 

rated assets, but HBK prided itself on its ability to run in-depth analysis and accurate stress tests 
on assets it selected for its CDOs.1365  HBK expected to receive a 15% return on its investment in 
the equity tranche.1366  In its investor presentation, HBK stated:  “The firm strives to provide 
superior risk-adjusted rates of return with relatively low volatility and relatively low correlation 
to most major market indices.”1367  HBK’s presentation also claimed that, as of January 2007, it 
had only three downgrades in its asset backed security portfolio, and that its upgrade to 
downgrade ratio was 23 to 3.1368  Investor M&T Bank, who later purchased Gemstone 7 
securities, told the Subcommittee that it had relied on HBK’s assertions when choosing what it 
thought was an investment with “minimal risk.”1369

   

 
HBK informed the Subcommittee that it had never shorted any of the assets in its seven 
Gemstone CDOs, that its CDO trade book was evenly matched with long and short CDO assets 
during the 2006-2007 period,1370 and that it lost over $700 million in its Structured Credit 
business unit during 2007.1371
 

  

(b) Gemstone Asset Selection 

 

As the collateral manager, HBK selected the assets for Gemstone 7, subject to approval 

by Deutsche Bank’s structuring and trading groups before each asset could be placed in the 
Deutsche Bank warehouse account for the CDO.1372
  According to HBK and Deutsche Bank

personnel, the approval process worked in the following manner.  First, HBK identified the 
RMBS, CDO, and other securities it wanted to include or reference in the CDO.  HBK then sent 
an email to Mr. Lippmann or his traders at Deutsche Bank requesting that the identified assets be 
placed in the warehouse account for Gemstone 7.  Deutsche Bank traders, sometimes in 
consultation with Mr. Lamont’s structuring group, would then either approve or voice concerns 
regarding the proposed assets.  If they had concerns, the traders would work with HBK personnel 
to resolve them.  For example, on January 9, 2007, HBK’s Jason Lowry sent an email to Mr.  
Lippmann and his trader, Jordan Milman, with a list of RMBS securities proposed for inclusion 
in Gemstone 7, and asked:  “This is the last BB list for approval.  Could you take a look?”  On 
the same day, Mr. Milman wrote back: “approved contingent upon first pay defaults getting 
bought back on the 2 heat bonds.”1373

    

 
Although the Gemstone 7 offering circular did not describe Deutsche Bank’s role in the 

asset selection process, the private engagement agreement between HBK and Deutsche Bank 
did.1374  According to the terms of the engagement agreement, Deutsche Bank agreed to provide, 
among other items, the following service:  “advising the Issuer [Gemstone 7] and the Company 
[HBK] on the selection and acquisition of the Underlying Assets” and “the scope of due 
diligence for the Underlying Assets.”1375  Under both the engagement agreement and a separate 
risk sharing agreement, Deutsche Bank also had the right to reject assets selected by HBK for the 
Gemstone warehouse account.1376  When asked about Deutsche Bank’s obligations under these 
agreements, Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that he viewed Deutsche Bank as having an 
obligation to the entity, Gemstone 7, to price the assets accurately as they were purchased, which 
included comparing the price of each security or CDS contract on the date it went into the 
warehouse account to its market price and ensuring that the CDO did not overpay for the assets it 
purchased.1377  Mr. Lippmann’s trader, Mr. Milman, and Mr. Kamat, of Mr. Lamont’s CDO 
Group, agreed with that assessment.1378
not require Deutsche Bank to analyze the quality of the assets being purchased or how those 
assets were expected to perform.   

  All three also stated that the engagement agreement did 

 
On the other hand, documents reviewed by the Subcommittee indicate, in at least a few 
instances, that Deutsche Bank personnel voiced concerns about an RMBS security being placed 
in the deal due to performance concerns in addition to price.  For example, Mr. Kamat, who also 
assisted Mr. Lippmann’s trading desks, wrote to Mr. Jenks about the quality of an asset being 

                                                 
1373 See, e.g., 1/9/2007 email from Jason Lowry to Greg Lippmann, GEM7-00002154; and 12/11/2006 email from 
Greg Lippmann to Kevin Jenks, GEM7-00002805.  The term “heat” refers to an RMBS security issued by Home 
Equity Asset Trust.    
1374 The Gemstone 7 offering circular states that with regard to the purchase of underlying assets:  “The Issuer 
[Gemstone 7] will acquire Underlying Assets from a warehouse facility (the ‘Warehouse Facility’) provided by an 
affiliate of DBSI [Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.], which provides for the purchase of Asset-Backed Securities at the 
direction of the Collateral Manager [HBK] on behalf of the Issuer prior to the Closing Date.”  Gemstone 7 Offering

considered for Gemstone 7.  Mr. Kamat wrote:  “MLMI 2005-HE1 B3 [is] on credit watch – do 
you want to move this out of the portfolio – investors might question/resist[.]”  Mr. Jenks 
responded: “[N]o let’s leave it in[.]”1379

   

 
On another occasion, Mr. Jenks from HBK exchanged several emails with Mr. Lippmann 

about several RMBS securities that Mr. Jenks wanted to include in the Gemstone 7 warehouse 
account.  Mr. Jenks sent the list to Mr. Lippmann and wrote:  “please approve.”  Mr. Lippmann 
responded:  “ok approved but would like to lower these 2 pts each given recent press on fhlt and 
significant widening in the baa3 cds.  Is that cool?”  The term “fhlt” referred to RMBS securities 
issued by Fremont; by saying he wanted to “lower these 2 pts,” Mr. Lippman indicated he 
wanted to assign them a lower value for warehouse purposes.  Mr. Jenks replied:  “Greg, 
Fremont overall is really not trading badly just the ones on downgrade watch,” to which Mr. 
Lippmann responded:  “we have seen the fhlt 05-d bbb-trade wide ….  please work with me on 
this.  …  I am trying to work with you.”  Mr. Jenks replied: 

 
“Greg, I have been trying to work with you.  Doing trades just with you and not on bid 
lists.  But we play in the higher quality part of the market, I really expected you to 
approve the list as is.  We still have several hundred million of bonds to do in cds form to 
do [sic].”1380

   

HBK told the Subcommittee that it selected good quality bonds using a very complex

   HBK provided this description for the Subcommittee regarding the tools it used in 

“HBK used a statistically driven mortgage behavior model to help make trading decisions 
and select assets for inclusion in the Gemstone VII CDO.  Three separate database tools 
were utilized in this process.  First, HBK licensed a commercial database called LP 
Database, which contained detailed information and performance history for millions of 
non-agency mortgages.  The LP Database was a robust dataset comprising close to 80% 
of the market, back to the 1996 vintage.  Utilizing the data acquired from the LP

Database, HBK then developed a proprietary system called the Loss Model that 
forecasted the likelihood of default, prepayment, delinquency, or timely payment for an 
individual mortgage monthly over a ten-year time horizon.  The Loss Model made these 
forecasts based on a series of 50 loan characteristics, including whether the mortgage was 
a first or second lien mortgage, the type of mortgage (e.g., fixed or ARM), its geographic 
location, FICO score, loan-to-value ratio, and level of documentation, and projections of 
home price appreciation and unemployment rates.   
 
Finally, HBK merged the information from the Loss Model into a Bond Evaluation 
Engine, which was based on software licensed from Intex Solutions.  The Bond 
Evaluation Engine provided information that assisted HBK traders in pricing mortgage 
bonds and evaluating how the bonds might perform under certain stresses. …  This 
portion of the analysis focused on the structure and enhancements of the RMBS and how 
those structures would contribute to bond performance.”1383
 
Mr. Jenks of HBK told the Subcommittee that HBK “never had a bond that we thought 
was bad that was put in a CDO.”1384  Mr. Jenks also told the Subcommittee that he had frequent 
conversations with Mr. Lippmann, was aware of his “negative housing view,” but disagreed with 
the magnitude of Mr. Lippmann’s negative views.1385  Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that 
although he occasionally suggested bonds to Mr. Jenks for Gemstone 7, and Mr. Jenks at times 
purchased them, Mr. Jenks had strong views on the assets that should be included in the CDO 
and was not required to listen to him.  HBK and Deutsche Bank emails confirm that Mr. 
Lippmann or his traders offered at times to sell certain bonds to HBK, which occasionally 
purchased them.1386  Deutsche Bank sold five bonds from its inventory, with a value of more 
than $27 million, to HBK for inclusion in Gemstone 7.1387  According to Mr. Lamont, his CDO 
Group was “agnostic” towards the quality of the assets that HBK purchased for Gemstone 7, and 
told the Subcommittee that investors had relied on HBK, the collateral manager, to analyze their 
quality.1388  Mr. Lamont said that the role of the CDO Group was, not to select the CDO’s assets, 
but to structure the deal and then use models to conduct stress tests on it.1389

(c)  Gemstone Risks and Poor Quality Assets 
 
Gemstone 7’s assets were assembled in late 2006 and early 2007, when the mortgage 

market was deteriorating and subprime mortgages were experiencing record delinquency rates.  
The CDO posed a host of risks due to both the state of the market and the poor quality of many 
of its underlying assets. 

 
Credit Report.  In December 2006, Mr. Lamont’s CDO Group prepared a Credit Report 

for Deutsche Bank’s credit risk management group to obtain internal approval for the 
securitization of Gemstone 7.1390
Deutsche Bank regarding Gemstone 7, including the possibility that the bank would be unable to 
sell $400 million of the Gemstone securities, which carried “significant” risk: 

  The Credit Report noted the following business risks for 

 
•  “The portfolio is concentrated on RMBS obligations, with 67.6%, 20.2% and 1.9% of 

the RMBS exposure represented by 2005, 2006, and 2007 vintages, respectively, 
which results in significant vintage risk.” 

 
•  “RMBS accounts for ~90.0% of the initial collateral portfolio.”   
 
•  “All unsold tranches have been taken back by HBK except for the Class A-1B 

($400mm). Currently, we are working with [redacted] to see if they will be interested 
in taking the tranche.  The plan for distribution if [redacted] decides not to take the 
tranche, will be a senior sequential repack.  The Class A-1B will be broken into two 
tranches.  DB will take the senior part (Class A-1B(i) $200mm) and HBK will take 
the bottom part (Class A-1B(i) $200mm).  Once the repack is setup, then DB will try 
to syndicate the Class A-1B(i).” 1391

 

 
The business risks described in the internal Deutsche Bank credit report relating to 

“significant vintage risk” for the 2005, 2006, and 2007 vintage RMBS securities1392
disclosed in the Gemstone 7 offering materials given to investors.  Although the March 15, 2007 
Offering Circular contained a “Risk Factor” section describing multiple risks associated with an 
investment in Gemstone 7, including those associated with residential asset backed securities, the 
Offering Circular was silent with respect to the above risks identified in the Credit Report, which 
were highlighted for Deutsche Bank management.

of the document.

The Offering Circular did, however, describe in detail a number of significant risks 

associated with RMBS securities.  For example, it stated: 

358 

 
•  “The risk of losses on residential mortgage loans is particularly relevant now.  While 

there is always a risk of defaults or delinquencies in payment, recently losses on 
residential mortgage loans have been increasing and may continue to increase in the 
future.  The losses have been most significant in respect of subprime mortgage loans 
but all are affected. 
 

•  A number of factors are contributing to the increase in losses.  Residential property 

values that increased for many years are now declining. … Declining property values 
also exacerbate the losses due to a failure to apply adequate standards to potential 
borrowers. Failures to properly screen borrowers may include failures to do adequate 
due diligence on a borrower (including employment and income history) or the 
relevant property (including valuation) or failures to follow predatory lending and the 
other borrower-protection statutes.  Increases in interest rates may also contribute to 
higher rates of loss. ... 
 

•  The increase in delinquencies and defaults has contributed to a declining market for 

mortgage loans.  The declining market has, in turn, seriously impacted mortgage 
originators and servicers. … The financial difficulties of servicers in particular are 
likely to result in losses in respect of securities backed by residential mortgage loans. 
…  At any one time, the portfolio of Residential ABS Securities may be backed by 
residential loans with disproportionately large aggregate principal amounts secured 
by properties in only a few states or regions.”1393

   

 

Long Beach-Fremont-New Century Bonds.  A substantial portion of the cash and 

 
These disclosures demonstrate that both HBK and Deutsche Bank were well aware of the 
deteriorating mortgage market and increased risks associated with RMBS and CDO securities, 
even as they were marketing the Gemstone 7 securities and claiming HBK had applied careful 
analysis in the asset selection process to ensure good quality CDO securities. 
 
 
synthetic assets included in Gemstone 7, 30% in all, involved subprime residential mortgages 
issued by three subprime lenders, Long Beach, Fremont, and New Century, all known for issuing 
poor quality loans and securities.1394
  Loans by these lenders were among the first to collapse.  
According to Moody’s, these three originators, plus WMC Corporation, accounted for 31% of 
                                                 
1393 3/15/2007 Offering Circular for Gemstone CDO VII, Ltd., GEM7-00000427-816 at 483-84.   While an earlier 
offering circular for Gemstone 7, dated February 14, 2007, identifies some risks associated with the CDO, the March 
offering circular contains additional language, quoted above, on the risks associated with the deteriorating mortgage 
market.  2/14/2007 Offering Circular for Gemstone CDO VII, Ltd., PSI-M&T_Bank-02-0001-370. 
1394 For more information on these three lenders, see sections D(3)(d) and E(2)(c)-(d) of Chapter IV.  Mr. Jenks of 
HBK told the Subcommittee that he saw data showing that Long Beach and Fremont were poor performers, but he 
thought the performance varied depending upon the tranche, and he believed he could pick the better tranches.  He 
thought he could buy low, structure the deal well, and make money.  Subcommittee interview of Kevin Jenks 
(10/13/2010). 

359 

During the period when securities were being assembled for the Gemstone 7 warehouse 

 
the subprime RMBS securities issued in 2006, but 63% of the rating downgrades issued in the 
second week of July 2007, when the mass rating downgrades began.1395
 
 
in late 2006 and early 2007, Mr. Lippmann frequently disparaged many of the same assets he and 
his traders allowed to be included in Gemstone 7.  About $27 million of these assets came from 
Deutsche Bank’s own inventory.  In emails to colleagues and his clients, Mr. Lippmann used 
words like “crap” and “pig” to describe the assets.  Mr. Lippmann brought some of the assets of 
Gemstone 7 to the attention of some of his clients that shorted these assets.1396
 

   

   

On October 20, 2006, for example, one of Mr. Lippmann’s clients sent him an email 

seeking advice about certain subprime bonds issued by Long Beach Mortgage Loan and Trust 
(LBMLT) and other originators.  Mr. Lippmann responded:  
 

“LBMLT-06-5 M9-375.  Long Beach is one of the weakest names in the market.  We 
shorted this bond to a CDO in the mid-300s on October 13[.]  Deal was done before S&P 
changed their criteria on July 1.  Lots of 40 year mortgages ….  Less than half the loans 
have full documentation and 10% are investor properties.  This is a real pig.  
 
 LBMLT -06-2 M9 350.  See above on Long Beach.  This one is already performing 
poorly with substantial delinquencies .…  Further the FICO is less than the 06-05 and 
there are fewer full doc loans.  This seems a better short than the 06-5.  Only reason I can 
think for my guys showing you a tighter level is that we are short this one and that the 
June 06 deals have a taint that earlier months don[’]t due to the theory that late June deals 
were crammed with bad stuff in order to beat the S & P revisions.”1397
 
Despite these negative views of Long Beach, Mr. Lippmann’s group raised no concerns 

   

 

when $25 million in LBMLT 2006-5 M9 securities was purchased by HBK for Gemstone 7’s 
warehouse account, $20 million of which was purchased on October 24, 2006, four days after 
Mr. Lippmann’s email.  Altogether, a total of $79.5 million in Long Beach bonds went into 
Gemstone 7.1398

 
  
Mr. Lippmann had similar negative views of RMBS securities containing subprime loans 
originated by Fremont, yet his group did not object to including Fremont securities in Gemstone 
7.  For instance, on December 6, 2006, Mr. Lippmann’s traders did not object to including $20 
million of an RMBS known as SABR 2005-FR4 B3, which contained Fremont loans, in 
Gemstone 7.1399

  One week earlier, on November 29, 2006, when asked by a bank colleague

Mr. Lippmann made similar negative remarks about RMBS securities containing 

 
about the same RMBS security, Mr. Lippmann labeled it a “pig.”1400  Two days later, on 
December 1, 2006, Mr. Lippmann declared in an email to a client that the security was “blowing 
up.”1401
   
 
In addition, on November 29, 2006, Mr. Lippmann called still another RMBS security 
with Fremont loans, FHLT 2005-A M9, a “pig.”1402  Yet a month earlier, on October 30, 2006, 
approximately $1 million of FHLT 2005-A M9 had been purchased for Gemstone 7, with no 
objection from Mr. Lippmann’s trading desk.1403
 
 
subprime loans originated by New Century.  On November 28, 2006, Mr. Lippmann wrote: 
“MABS 2005-NC2 M9 … huge payment shock coming.”1404  Yet six weeks later, on January 17, 
2007, $10 million of this exact asset, MABS 2005-NC2 M9, was purchased by Gemstone 7, 
without objection from Mr. Lippmann’s traders.1405  On December 8, 2006, Mr. Lippmann wrote 
about another New Century security underwritten by Goldman Sachs:  “GSAMP 06-nc2 m8 this 
is an absolute pig.”1406  Although Gemstone 7 did not purchase the M8 securities, it did purchase 
a total of $30 million in GSAMP 2006-NC2 M9 securities – from a lower tranche in the same 
securitization with less subordination.  It purchased those securities over a month-long period, 
with $10 million of the securities on November 13, 2006; another $10 million on December 8, 
2006; and still another $10 million on December 21, 2006.1407  In addition, on December 18, 
2006, Gemstone 7 purchased $8.8 million worth of a similar security, GSAMP 2006-NC2 
B2.1408

   

 

Mr. Lippmann was equally critical of New Century loans securitized by ACE, an entity 

  On March 2, 2007, a client sent an email to Mr. Lippmann stating:  “[T]hey are 

created by and associated with Deutsche Bank.  On September 21, 2006, for example, when 
asked by a Deutsche Bank salesperson for his opinion of ACE 2006-NC1 M9, an RMBS issued 
by ACE with New Century subprime loans, Mr. Lippmann responded that ACE was “generally 
horrible.”1409

02.  Mr. Lippmann confirmed to the Subcommittee that he believed ACE was “horrible.”  Subcommittee interview 
of Greg Lippmann (10/18/2010).   On May 19, 2006, Mr. Lippmann wrote to a Deutsche Bank colleague, “We 
traded that ACE piece of crap with Ike at 380.”  5/19/2006 email from Greg Lippmann to Rocky Kurita at Deutsche 
Bank, DBSI_PSI_EMAIL0120552.  On May 29, 2007, Mr. Lippmann wrote with regard to ACE 2006-ASP3 M7, 

 
claiming that DB [Deutsche Bank] was one of the last ones to tighten standards on buying loans 
to securitize. [Y]ou were right - ACE is crap.”  Mr. Lippmann responded:  “INDEED … IT 
IS.”1410 Yet on December 19, 2006, Mr. Lippmann’s traders did not object to the purchase of $10 
million of ACE 2006-NC1 M9 for Gemstone 7.1411
  

Mr. Lippmann also had negative opinions about other securities purchased for Gemstone 

 

7.   On March 1, 2007, for example, Mr. Lippmann wrote that ABSHE 2006-HE1 M7 was 
“crap.”1412  But $5 million of this same security had been purchased three months earlier by 
Gemstone 7, on November 16, 2006, without objection from Mr. Lippmann’s trading desk.1413   
In still another instance, on March 19, 2007, Mr. Milman described FFML 2006-FF13 as “a 
piece of crap.”1414  Yet over the prior five months, the Lippmann trading desk had approved the 
purchase of a total of $38.5 million of this exact bond, FFML 2006-FF13, for inclusion in 
Gemstone 7:  $11.7 million of the class B1 securities on October 30, 2006; $16.2 million of the 
class B2 securities on November 17, 2006 and January 9, 2007; and $10.6 million of the class 
M9 securities on March 15, 2007.1415

  

361 

 
Securities from Deutsche Bank’s Inventory.  Gemstone 7 purchased five securities 

totaling $27 million directly from Deutsche Bank’s inventory.1416  Mr. Lippmann, and his trader 
Jordan Milman, shared negative views of one of the bonds, ACE 2006-HE1 M10, a security in 
which over 75% of the loans had been originated by Fremont.1417  In an instant message 
conversation in December 2006, Mr. Lippmann asked Mr. Milman his thoughts on ACE 2006-
HE1 M10.  Mr. Lippmann asked:  “DOESNT THIS DEAL BLOW,” to which Mr. Milman 
replied: “yes it blows I am seeing 20-40% writedowns.”1418  Not only did HBK include $10 
million of this asset in the Gemstone 7 warehouse account, HBK purchased it from Deutsche 
Bank that same month through one of Mr. Lippmann’s traders.1419
  Thus, Deutsche Bank 
allowed Gemstone 7 to acquire a $10 million asset that its traders believed would perform 
poorly, and effectively removed the financial risk of this asset from its own inventory, shifting it 
to its customers.

Mr. Lippmann expressed a negative outlook for other assets as well, including SABR 

 
2005-OP1, that was taken from Deutsche Bank’s inventory and sold to Gemstone 7.  On August 
26, 2006, Mr. Lippmann wrote to a client about more securities “blowing up,” including SABR 
2005-OP1: 
 

“I am encouraged that in spite of the virility of the cdo bid, there are numerous examples 
of bonds blowing up … the tripling of serious delinq [delinquencies] in sabr 05-opl to 
over 6.5% since feb even though the avg [average] mortgage age is now only 21 months 
i.e. hasn’t reset yet .… What I’m saying is there is plenty of fundamental evidence that 
bonds are blowing up even as the new issue and index market are remaining 
buoyant.”1420
 

  

A third example involved securities issued by Ameriquest Mortgage Securities Inc. 

On December 12, 2006, with no objection from Mr. Lippmann’s desk, Gemstone 7 purchased 
$5.5 million of SABR 2005-OP1 B4 from Deutsche Bank, the same asset that he had described 
months earlier as incurring “serious delinquencies.”1421
 
 
(AMSI), which Gemstone purchased from Deutsche Bank’s inventory.  On April 6, 2006, Mr. 
Lippmann called AMSI 2005-R7 M8 a “crap name.”1422 In a June 16, 2006 email, Mr. Lippmann 
called AMSI generally a “weakish name.”1423  On December 12, 2006, Gemstone 7 purchased $5 
million of another RMBS, AMSI 2005-R11 M10, with no objection from the Lippmann trading 
desk.1424
 

   

   

In still another instance, Deutsche Bank praised its sales force for placing a security it 

was having difficulty selling as the underwriter, Deutsche Alt-A Securities Inc. (DBALT) 2006-
AR6, in Gemstone 7.  On November 17, 2006, the Deutsche Bank Option Arms Desk sent the 
following email, “The Arms Desk would like to express its sincere appreciation to the sales force 
for an outstanding job in helping us place the bonds off DBALT 06-AR6.  Thanks a lot!!”1425

Many investors would likely have found the negative views of Mr. Lippmann, Deutsche 
Bank’s top CDO trader, important to their decision as to whether or not to buy Gemstone 7, but 
his views, as described above, were not disclosed to them.  At the time, the traders on his desk as 
well as other Deutsche Bank CDO personnel knew that many clients valued and relied on Mr. 
Lippmann’s opinion when making investment decisions, yet did not disclose his views of the 
specific assets included in Gemstone 7.1428  M&T Bank told the Subcommittee that had it known 
about Mr. Lippmann’s views, it might have “thought twice” before purchasing Gemstone 7 
securities.1429

   

 
(d)  Gemstone Sales Effort 

 

Deutsche Bank began aggressively marketing Gemstone 7 to investors beginning in 
January 2007.1430  The bank communicated with potential investors about Gemstone 7 in a 
variety of ways, including through emails, telephone calls, face to face meetings, and at 
conferences.  Deutsche Bank personnel also went on what they called “road shows” to cities 
around the world, to meet investors and pitch the CDO to them.1431
Deutsche Bank CDO sales force, and Ilinca Bogza, a vice president in the Deutsche Bank 
syndicate group, worked to market Gemstone 7 to investors, including by scheduling road shows 
and personal meetings with potential investors. 

  Sean Whelan, co-head of the 

 
Investors were typically shown a “Debt Investor Presentation” that had been prepared by 

HBK and Deutsche Bank.1432  That presentation provided an overview of the transaction, a 
description of HBK’s organization, and its investment strategy.  The presentation highlighted 
investment considerations, including HBK’s expertise in the capital markets, how its structured 
products exhibit relatively stable performance, and their low default history.  The presentation 
also contained a description of HBK’s analytical systems and surveillance capabilities, and 
included an appendix describing the risk factors for the deal.  HBK told the Subcommittee that 
its employees attended investor meetings, and were at times called upon to answer questions, but 
did not always participate in the Gemstone 7 sales efforts which were led by Deutsche Bank.1433

1433 Subcommittee interview of Kevin Jenks (10/13/2010).  

 

One Gemstone investor, M&T Bank, told the Subcommittee that, after observing a 

presentation made by Mr. Jenks and receiving Deutsche Bank’s assurances in connection with its 
solicitation efforts, it believed that Gemstone 7 securities posed minimal investment risk.1434  
According to the transcript of a telephone call on February 5, 2007, Sean Whelan of Deutsche 
Bank’s sales force pitched the Gemstone 7 deal to M&T Bank and stated in part:  “If you 
indicate early, like Gemstone deals go very well, and this deal will all go very well and it will get 
oversubscribed.”1435  The following day, February 6, 2007, Mr. Whelan again pitched the deal to 
M&T and stated that Gemstone 7 “was like a lay up.”1436  When asked about these comments, 
Mr. Whelan told the Subcommittee that what he meant was that working with a quality hedge 
fund like HBK was a “lay up,” not that the Gemstone 7 deal itself was a “lay up.”1437  With 
regards to his comment about oversubscription, he said he was referring to the tranches that 
M&T Bank was considering purchasing, which ultimately were fully subscribed.1438

In early 2007, as the closing date for Gemstone 7 neared, the Deutsche Bank sales force 

was having difficulty getting commitments from investors to buy Gemstone securities.  Many 
investors who were solicited declined to invest because of concerns about the high concentration 
in subprime RMBS with BBB or BB ratings.1439
  In the beginning of 2007, there was a general 
lack of buyer interest in mortgage related securities in the United States, other than from new 
CDOs purchasing CDO securities from prior deals.  It was not the first time, however, that a 
Gemstone deal involving Deutsche Bank and HBK could not be fully sold.  HBK had 
conditioned Deutsche Bank’s participation in Gemstone 7 on its purchasing unsold securities 
from Gemstone 4 and 5, BB rated securities that HBK still had on its books for $13.1 million.  In 
an email sent to a colleague, an HBK Managing Director Jamiel Akhtar wrote:   

 
“As a condition for receiving the underwriting mandate, Kevin [Jenks] and I insisted that 
DB [Deutsche Bank] buy from us the $13.1mm of BB rated CDO liabilities HBK 
retained on its own books from Gemstone IV and V.  This was a fairly sharp-elbowed 
tactic on our part, as the BB bonds are the worst part of the capital structure, but I felt like 
we should be sharp-elbowed with DB right now.”1440
 
The head of Deutsche Bank’s CDO Group, Michael Lamont, sent an email to the CDO 
Group banker assigned lead responsibility for structuring Gemstone 7, acknowledging the risk 
the bank took on by purchasing the earlier unsold securities, but also noting the “nice” fee being 
paid to the bank:  “[T]hat is part of the risk we took when we were awarded the mandate and we 
are still making a nice all in fee.”1441
  When Deutsche Bank told HBK that it intended to resell 
the Gemstone 4 and 5 securities, the HBK official indicated it was “ok with that as long as it is

not blasted out to everyone so as not to affect his current deal [Gemstone 7] in the market.”1442
  
Deutsche Bank and HBK did not disclose in the Gemstone 7 offering materials both the bank’s 
purchase of the Gemstone 4 and 5 securities as a precondition to the deal and the bank’s plan to 
sell the Gemstone 4 and 5 securities contemporaneously with the Gemstone 7 securities. 

Struggle to Sell Gemstone.  Evidence obtained by the Subcommittee shows that both 
HBK and Deutsche Bank were concerned about their exposure should Gemstone 7 not be fully 
subscribed and worked hard to sell the deal in the face of U.S. investor disinterest.1443  
According to the terms of the Gemstone deal, if the securities were not fully sold, the risk of the 
first $80 million in losses would fall on HBK, while all remaining losses would fall on Deutsche 
Bank.1444  On February 27, 2007, Mr. Kamat of Deutsche Bank wrote to Mr. Jenks of HBK 
about selling the Gemstone 4 and 5 securities and brought up the CDO Group’s need to reduce 
risk:  “[W]e are trying to reduce our exposure right now given internal very senior mgmt review 
of our business.” Mr. Jenks responded: “We are also trying to reduce exposure.”1445

  

 
In January 2007, Michael Lamont, head of Deutsche Bank’s CDO Group, and Mr. Jenks, 

365 

the HBK collateral manager, discussed the urgency of selling Gemstone 7 in the face of a 
deteriorating market.  On January 9, 2007, Mr. Jenks wrote to Mr. Lamont: “[W]ith this market 
this way and probably going to get worse we would like to really move on the cdo.  Please 
allocate the resources to expedite this.”  Four minutes later Mr. Lamont responded: “[W]e are 
focused on this as well.  We don’t have a deal in the market and you will be first.”1446

 

 
Several developments in early 2007 signaled problems in the mortgage industry.  On 

January 29, 2007, subprime lender Fremont Investment & Loan announced that it had “severed 
ties” with 8,000 brokers whose loans had high delinquency rates.1447  The following week on 
February 7, 2007, New Century, another major subprime lender, disclosed in a conference call 
with investors that “the level of early-payment defaults and loan repurchases [had] led to tighter 
underwriting guidelines,” that its nonprime loan production would be declining, and that it would 
be restating its earnings.1448
  An additional warning to the market that occurred as Gemstone was 
being marketed to investors was the plunge in the ABX Index that tracked the value of subprime 
RMBS securities.  In February 2007, the ABX Index fell from a high of $0.90 early in the month

1443 Subcommittee interview of Kevin Jenks (10/13/2010).  Mr. Jenks recalled that there were more non U.S. 
investors in CDOs in 2007, but he believed that was because there was not much of a CDO market in Europe.

to $0.69 by the end of the month, indicating a drop of more than 23% in the value of subprime 
RMBS securities.1449
  These and other events affected both the RMBS and CDO markets, since 
so many CDOs included or referenced subprime RMBS securities. 

 
Emails reviewed by the Subcommittee show that CDO personnel at Deutsche Bank were 
well aware of the worsening CDO market and were rushing to sell Gemstone 7 before the market 
collapsed.  On February 7, 2007, Mr. Lippmann, reacting to the New Century developments, 
raised concerns with Mr. Lamont about the ability of Deutsche Bank to continue to sell CDO 
securities:  “I was calling about warehouse marks and distribution risk b/c [because] hearing 
rumors about other dealers having big trouble placing this stuff.”1450  The next day, February 8, 
2007, Mr. Lamont told Abhayad Kamat, the CDO Group employee structuring Gemstone 7:  
“[R]egardless we need to sell it [Gemstone 7] now while we still can.”1451  The same day, Mr. 
Lamont wrote to Mr. Jenks at HBK:  “Keep your fingers crossed but I think we will price this 
just before the market falls off a cliff.”1452  The next day, February 9, 2007, Ilinca Bogza, of the 
Deutsche Bank syndicate group, wrote to Mr. Lamont:  “Jenks just called me.  …  He is 
frightened that accounts will pull their orders given the widening in abx today.  …  He 
mentioned he was going to give you a call.  He is very nervous.”1453

  

 
On February 13, 2007, the head of Deutsche Bank’s syndicate group, Anthony 

Pawlowski, wrote to Mr. Lamont:  “I am not sure how to push guys upstairs without having them 
crack.  Everyone wants to price this deal asap (Sean Whelan [co-head of Deutsche Bank’s CDO 
sales force] is pushing for Friday to lock up his guys on the AAA and AA)[.]  Let me know.”1454
A week later, on February 20, 2007, Mr. Lamont wrote to Deutsche Bank syndicate to ask: 

  

 
“[O]n our managed mezz[anine] abs [asset backed security] CDOs last year what was the 
split by risk tranche across deals between real money and cdo warehouses.  The street 
may be pulling back so this would be good info to have as we think about how we are 
going to place risk.”1455

   

                                                 
1449 On Feb. 23, 2007, MarketWatch announced:  “The ABX.HE index that tracks CDS on the riskiest subprime 
loans, rated BBB-, that were sold in the second half of 2006 fell to $0.69 on Friday, according to Markit.com, which 
administers the indexes. That’s down from $0.72 on Thursday and $0.79 at the beginning of the week. In early 
February, this index was above 90.” “Subprime mortgage derivatives index plunges; Bankruptcies, losses in

In one odd instance, Ms. Bogza, from the CDO syndicate, sent an email to the Deutsche 
Bank sales force suggesting that Gemstone 7 was experiencing greater investor interest than it 
really was.  The February 20, 2007 email by Ms. Bogza stated that the bank had received an 
“indication of [investor] interest” in 75% of the BBB securities in Gemstone 7.1456  After 
receiving this email, Mr. Lippmann wrote to Ms. Bogza: “[W]ow that much interest in the bbb?  
Is that real??  We would take as much as you can oversell.”1457 Ms. Bogza responded:  “no.  that 
is def[initely] not real .. it is at 50%.; cant oversell any tranche to be honest,” to which Mr. 
Lippmann responded:  “very sneaky.”1458

   

In late February, as the market continued to deteriorate, Deutsche Bank attempted to 

motivate its employees to sell Gemstone 7 by providing special incentives to its sales force for 
selling the deal.  On February 21, 2007, Mr. Kamat wrote to Ms. Bogza:  “[W]e need help on 
selling the As and BBBs in the Gemstone CDO 7 transaction – we have nearly 50% unsold on 
both tranches in the transaction.”1459  In another email the same day, he wrote:  “[S]hould we 
offer more PCs for Gemstone 7 CDO given the market?”1460 “PCs” refers to Production Credits, 
which were used to boost a salesperson’s compensation including through an end-of-year bonus.  
Later the same night, Mr. Kamat sent an email to the co-head of the CDO Group seeking to 
increase the Production Credits that could be awarded for selling Gemstone 7:  “[D]ouble digit 
PCs?   I guess my original offer of 300 on single-As and 600 on triple-Bs is too low … what can 
we offer?”1461

Showing Investors Higher Marks.  As the value of mortgage related assets grew more 

volatile, some potential investors in Gemstone 7 inquired about the mark to market (MTM) value 
of the CDO’s underlying assets.  MTM is a valuation method by which the current value of an 
asset is recorded on a firm’s books at the price it would sell in the marketplace on the day it is 
marked.  Investors at times inquire about MTM values to determine if the underlying assets of a 
CDO have dropped in value since their inclusion in the warehouse account.  Traders who closely 
follow buy and sell activity for a particular class of assets are generally best able to provide the 
most accurate current valuation.  At Deutsche Bank, the CDO Trading Desk marked the value of 
assets monthly as a service to its clients and at times provided this service to HBK for the assets 
underlying Gemstone 7.1462  HBK also prepared its own internal marks valuing Gemstone’s 
assets.  According to both Deutsche Bank and HBK, assigning a mark is a very complicated 
process that involves credit analysis of the securities at issue.  Both explained it was not unusual 
for different entities to mark an asset differently.1463

During the marketing phase of Gemstone 7, documents indicate several potential 

investors asked Deutsche Bank to provide MTM values for the underlying assets in the CDO.  In 
response, those potential investors were given HBK’s marks, rather than the generally lower  

valuations assigned to the assets by Deutsche Bank’s CDO Trading Desk.   On January 23, 2007, 
Mr. Kamat sent an email to HBK explaining that some potential investors had requested marks 
for the Gemstone 7 assets: 
 

“Some investors are asking for current marks on the Gemstone 7 CDO portfolio.  The 
attached file has the purchase price and the current marks that we got from our desk.  
There are many bonds where the price difference between purchase price and current 
mark is more than 4% .…  I have asked Jordan [Milman, a Deutsche Bank trader] to 
review the marks but it would be great if you could have someone at HBK review also to 
check if the current marks seem correct.  It seems as if the entire portfolio price has 
dropped since purchase by 1.74% which does not show well to investors.”1464
 
Before he heard back from HBK, Mr. Kamat sent a very similar request to Mr. Milman to 

     

 
review the marks to verify them.  He wrote: 
 

“There are many [Gemstone 7] bonds where the price difference between purchase price 
and the current mark is more than 4% .…  Before we send these over to CDO investors, 
pls could you review to check if the current marks are correct.  It seems as if the entire 
portfolio price has dropped since purchase by 1.74% which does not show well to 
investors.”1465

 

 

On January 23, 2007, Mr. Kamat learned that HBK’s marks showed a loss of 0.9% or 

 
The next day, a Deutsche Bank trader verified the marks:  “I checked the names that Abhayad 
[Kamat] highlighted [and] most are marked within the recent color[.]  [T]here are 4 which should 
be tightened.”1466
 
 
$9.4 million in the Gemstone 7 portfolio, while Deutsche Bank’s marks showed a greater loss of 
1.7% or $19 million.1467 On January 24, 2007, Mr. Kamat directed Deutsche Bank’s syndicate 
group to share HBK’s marks with investors instead of Deutsche Bank’s.  He wrote:  “[F]or 
investors who have asked for current marks on the Gemstone CDO 7 portfolio, tell them:  HBK 
says that the overall current portfolio is down USD 9 million.”1468
 
                                                 
1464 1/23/2007 email from Abhayad Kamat to HBK, GEM7-00003101.  This document has HBK showing a loss of 
$9.4 million in the value of the Gemstone assets, whereas Deutsche Bank showed a loss of $19 million.  In 
interviews with the Subcommittee, both Mr. Milman and Mr. Lippmann said that a 1.74% drop would not have 
concerned them because of the relative small dollars involved compared to the $1.1 billion deal.

A couple weeks later, a question arose about using Deutsche Bank marks for Gemstone 7.  

On February 7, 2007, Ms. Bogza from the syndicate group wrote to Mr. Kamat:  “Why can we 
not show a priced [marked] portfolio??  We need to show this [to investors].”   Mr. Kamat 
responded:  “[T]he marks we got from Jordan are too low … and it will take quite some time if 
we try to take on an exercise where we try to get kevin and jordan to agree on the correct 
marks.”1469  Mr. Kamat wrote to another colleague later that day:  “[U]se this for the current 
prices to be sent to investors, but please note to investors that this is from HBK.”1470   HBK also 
appeared to want to show higher marks to investors.  When Mr. Kamat emailed Mr. Jenks 
seeking marks for the Gemstone 7 portfolio on February 7, Mr. Jenks sent an internal email to an 
HBK assistant trader.  Mr. Jenks wrote: “Need line item marks for cdo portfolio[.]  use dec or jan 
depending on which is better[.]1471

 
When asked about these documents, Mr. Kamat stated that he advised using HBK’s

the biggest traders in RMBS and CDOs on Wall Street, making it unlikely that the desk could not 
adequately price the assets that it traded.  Deutsche Bank also chose not to share both sets of 
marks with investors; it shared only the HBK marks showing higher asset values. 

  However, Deutsche Bank’s trading desk was one of 

 

 

When HBK was asked about this matter, Mr. Jenks told the Subcommittee that he did not 

authorize Deutsche Bank to give out HBK’s marks to investors and would be “surprised” if 
Deutsche Bank had given out HBK’s marks.1473  Mr. Jenks only recalled one time when an 
investor asked Deutsche Bank for Gemstone 7 marks.  When the Subcommittee asked several of 
the investors who ultimately purchased Gemstone securities if they had asked for marks showing 
the current value of the underlying assets, M&T Bank told the Subcommittee that it did not know 
to ask for marks.1474  Standard Chartered, Wachovia, and Commerzbank told the Subcommittee 
that they did not ask for the marks and it would have been unusual for them to do so.  Eight days 
before the Gemstone CDO closed and its securities issued, HBK estimated that its portfolio 
marks were down approximately $30 million.1475
 

$400 Million of Unsold Securities.  The mortgage market continued to worsen in March 

as Deutsche Bank continued to market the Gemstone securities.  On March 8, 2007, one week 
before the Gemstone 7 deal closed, New Century – the subprime lender whose RMBS securities 
made up part of Gemstone – filed an 8-K with the SEC which said:  “The Company has only 
been able to fund a portion of its loans this week.  In addition, its capacity to fund new 
originations is substantially limited due to its lenders’ restrictions or refusals to allow the

Company to access their financing arrangements.”1476  New Century’s financial troubles were 
prominently reported in the financial press on March 11, 2007.1477  On March 15, 2007, the day 
Gemstone 7 closed, Bear Stearns said that “residential mortgage-related revenue decreased from 
the prior year period, reflecting weakness in the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities 
market.  …  New Century Financial Corp., which had been a major provider of loans to people 
with risky credit, said it has lost support from its financial backers and is being delisted from the 
NYSE.”1478
 
 
Ultimately $400 million of Gemstone 7 was unsold.  Although not contractually 
obligated to do so, Deutsche Bank agreed to split the unsold $400 million of Gemstone 7 
securities between itself and HBK.1479  Meetings concerning taking back the $400 million were 
held at the highest levels of both Deutsche Bank and HBK.1480  As Mr. Lippmann put it:  “[W]e 
don’t have much choice … either we repo for them or we take it down.”1481

  New Century comprised 15% of Gemstone 7.

Lippmann sent an email to Mr. Misra, copying Mr. D’Albert, with a subject line: “Fremont Shut Down Sub-Prime 
business” that contained a number of negative news headlines concerning New Century including, “New Century 
says U.S. attorney conducting criminal probe … New Century says NYSE reviewing transactions in its securities … 
New Century says SEC requested meeting on restatement.”  The next day Mr. Misra replied to Mr. Lippmann, 
“Well, no regrets.  Let’s hold tight on our shorts now.  It will be a bumpy market to market ride but we will prevail.”

on a company that specializes in making mortgages to cash-poor homebuyers.  The company, New Century 
Financial, had already disclosed that a growing number of borrowers were defaulting, and its stock, at around $15, 
had lost half its value in three weeks. What happened next seems all too familiar to investors who bought technology 
stocks in 2000 at the breathless urging of Wall Street analysts.  Last week, New Century said it would stop making 
loans and needed emergency financing to survive. The stock collapsed to $3.21.”)

Deutsche Bank and HBK were unable to sell 36% of the securities and instead kept those 

securities on their books.  Mr. Jenks of HBK told the Subcommittee that he always wanted to 
know if unsold portions of a CDO he was interested in investing in would be bought back by the 
underwriter, but he did not know if everyone asked about this.1482  M&T Bank told the 
Subcommittee that it would have been useful information, though it would have been more 
concerned if the tranches it was purchasing were not fully subscribed.1483

   

 
(e)  Gemstone Losses 

 Gemstone 7 closed on March 15, 2007, and received credit ratings from S&P and 
Moody’s on the same day.1484  The top three tranches, representing 73% of the value of the 
CDO, received AAA ratings.  The next three tranches received investment grade ratings of AA, 
A, and BBB.1485
  The CDO received these ratings even though one third of its underlying assets 
carried non-investment grade ratings.   

 
Eight months later, in November 2007, five of its seven tranches were downgraded, 

including one of its AAA rated tranches.  By July 2008, all seven tranches had been downgraded 
to junk status, and the Gemstone securities were nearly worthless.  This chart, using S&P data, 
displays the downgrades.1486

Investors contacted by the Subcommittee reported that they had lost all or most of their 

investments.  In June 2008, M&T Bank wrote down the value of its Gemstone 7 securities to 
about 2% of their original value – from $82 million to $1.87 million.1487  Wachovia Bank told 
the Subcommittee that its $40 million investment in Gemstone paid out approximately $3 million 
from 2007-2010, but is currently worth nothing.1488  Standard Chartered Bank told the 
Subcommittee that, in 2008, it liquidated its Gemstone investment and received approximately 
25-30% of its initial $224 million investment.1489  Commerzbank told the Subcommittee that its 
initial $16 million investment in Gemstone is currently worth nothing.1490

 
(6)  Other Deutsche Bank CDOs   
 
Gemstone 7 was only one of many CDOs that Deutsche Bank assembled and underwrote 

 
as the mortgage market deteriorated in 2007.  From December 2006 through December 2007, 
Deutsche Bank issued 15 new CDOs with assets totaling $11.5 billion.1491
  The Subcommittee 
did not examine these CDOs, but a brief discussion of a few shows that the bank’s issuance of 
high risk mortgage related assets was not confined to Gemstone 7.   
 

 

Magnetar CDOs.  Magnetar is a Chicago based hedge fund that, according to press 

reports, worked with several financial institutions to create CDOs with riskier assets and then bet 
on those CDOs to fail.1492
  Deutsche Bank underwrote one of those CDOs and served as trustee 
for two other Magnetar CDOs.   

 

According to press reports, Magnetar’s investment strategy was to purchase the riskiest 

portion of a CDO – the equity – and, at the same time, to purchase short positions on other 
tranches of the same CDO.1493  Thus, Magnetar would receive a large return on the equity if the 
security did well, but would also receive a substantial payment from its short positions if the 
securities lost value.  This strategy was dubbed by some as the “Magnetar Trade.”  It apparently 
generated large profits for Magnetar.  By the end of 2007, when the market was in turmoil, 
Magnetar’s Constellation Fund was up 76% and its Capital Fund was up 26%.1494

   

 
Mr. Lippmann disapproved of the Magnetar CDOs.1495

  In August 2006, when an 

investor asked Mr. Lippmann about Magnetar, he responded that it was a “Chicago based hedge

In May 2006, Magnetar created its first CDO, Orion 2006-1 Ltd., a $1.3 billion hybrid 

CDO with cash and synthetic assets.1497  The CDO closed on May 26, 2006, and was 
underwritten by Calyon and managed by NIBC Credit Management, Inc.1498   Deutsche Bank’s 
Special Situations Group purchased equity in Orion, and helped create the CDO.1499  A Deutsche 
Bank employee, Michael Henriques, who worked on Orion as managing director of the Special 
Situations Group, left Deutsche Bank and ultimately went to work for Magnetar.1500
 

Although Orion received investment grade ratings from Fitch and Moody’s in June 
2006,1501 a little over a year later, on August 21, 2007, Fitch issued the first of several rating 
downgrades.1502  In November 2007, Moody’s downgraded the Class A notes six notches and the 
Class B notes seven notches.1503  By May 2008, every class of Orion’s securities had been 
downgraded to junk status.1504

simultaneously bought CDS protection against the entire structure, essentially shorting the deal 
and betting that the value of its assets would fall.1506  On four of the deals, Deutsche Bank 
worked with Paulson Advisors, a hedge fund that bought the equity tranche and apparently 
shorted the rest of the CDO, while Deutsche Bank sold the rest of the securities.1507
Deutsche Bank email explained one of the 2005 START CDOs as follows:  

  An internal 

 
“The $1 billion START 2005-B trade was backed by a static pool of CDS on mezzanine 
RMBS for Paulson Advisors ($4 bln risk arb hedge fund).  Paulson retained the bottom 
6% of the trade and we sold the rest of the capital structure.  Paulson, who came to us 
with the strong desire to short the U.S. housing market, wrote CDS on underlying ABS 
(over 100 names) to DB [Deutsche Bank] and DB intermediated them into the deal.”1508
 
Mr. Lamont told the Subcommittee that Mr. Paulson shorted the START deals, and he 

  

believed investors were aware of that fact.  Mr. Lamont told the Subcommittee that Mr.  
Lippmann’s ABS desk shorted the START CDOs only in its role as an intermediary for other 
clients, which was confirmed by Mr. Lippmann.  In an email discussing START with a Deutsche 
Bank colleague, Mr. Lippmann advised him to buy protection for the bank against START.  He 
wrote:  “Start is crap you should short because I bet we’ll have to … buyback cash ones next 
year.”1509
 

Mr. Lippmann told the Subcommittee that Deutsche Bank ended up losing a great deal of 

   

money on the START deals.  One Deutsche Bank employee wrote to Mr. Lippmann regarding 
one of the deals in June 2007:  “This along with our remaining held inventory if we can’t sell 
away we repack into a CDO 2 balance sheet dump later this summer.  Worst case we hold it but 
it is probably the lesser of two evils (the greater evil being our held START position).”1510

  

 
(7)  Analysis 

 
 

 
Deutsche Bank was the fourth largest issuer of CDOs in the United States.  It continued 
to issue CDOs after mortgages began losing money at record rates, investor interest waned, and 
its most senior CDO trader concluded that the mortgage market in general and the specific 
RMBS securities being included in the bank’s own CDOs were going to lose value.  Mr. 
Lippmann derided specific RMBS securities and advised his clients to short them, at the same 
time his desk was allowing the very same securities to be included or referenced in Gemstone 7, 
a CDO that the bank was assembling for sale to its clients.  In fact, the bank was selling some 
assets that Mr. Lippmann believed contained “crap.”  While the Gemstone CDO was constructed 
and marketed by the bank’s CDO Desk, which is separate from the trading desk controlled by 
Mr. Lippmann, both desks knew of Mr. Lippmann’s negative views.  The bank managed to sell

This case history raises several concerns.  The first is that Deutsche Bank allowed the 

 
$700 million in Gemstone 7 securities which then failed within months, leaving the bank’s 
clients with worthless investments.  
 
inclusion of Gemstone 7 assets which its most senior CDO trader was asked to review and saw 
as likely to lose value.  Second, the bank sold poor quality assets from its own inventory to the 
CDO.  Third, the bank aggressively marketed the CDO securities to clients despite the negative 
views of its most senior CDO trader, falling values, and the deteriorating market.  Fourth, the 
bank failed to inform potential investors of Mr. Lippmann’s negative views of the underlying 
assets and its inability to sell over a third of Gemstone’s securities.  Each of these issues focuses 
on the poor quality of the financial product that Deutsche Bank helped assemble and sell.  Still 
another concern raised by this case history is the fact that the bank made large proprietary 
investments in the mortgage market that resulted in multi-billion-dollar losses – losses that, in 
this instance, did not require taxpayer relief but, due to their size, could have caused material 
damage to both U.S. investors and the U.S. economy.

C.  Failing to Manage Conflicts of Interest: 
      Case Study of Goldman Sachs 

 

The Goldman Sachs case study shows how one investment bank profited from the

collapse of the mortgage market and engaged in troubling and sometimes abusive practices that
raise multiple conflict of interest concerns.  The first part of this case study shows how Goldman
used structured finance products, including CDO, CDS, and ABX instruments, to take a
proprietary net short position against the subprime mortgage market.  Reaching its peak at $13.9
billion, Goldman’s net short investments realized record gains for the Structured Products Group
in 2007 of over $3.7 billion which, when combined with other mortgage losses, resulted in 
overall net revenues for Goldman’s Mortgage Department of $1.1 billion.  The second half of the
case study shows how Goldman engaged in securitization practices that magnified risk in the
market by selling high risk, poor quality mortgage products to investors around the world.  The
Hudson, Anderson, Timberwolf, and Abacus CDOs show how Goldman used these financial
instruments to transfer risk associated with its high risk assets, assist a favored client make a $1
billion gain, and profit at the direct expense of the clients that invested in the Goldman CDOs.  In
addition, the case study shows how conflicts of interest related to proprietary investments led
Goldman to conceal its adverse financial interests from potential investors, sell investors poor
quality investments, and place its financial interests before those of its clients. 

(1)  Subcommittee Investigation and Findings of Fact

During the course of its investigation into the Goldman Sachs case study, the

Subcommittee issued 13 document subpoenas as well as multiple document request letters to
financial institutions, government agencies, hedge funds, due diligence firms, insurance
companies, individuals, and others.  The Subcommittee obtained tens of millions of pages of
documents, including internal reports, memoranda, correspondence, spreadsheets, and email. 
The Subcommittee conducted over 55 interviews and one deposition, including interviews with a
variety of senior executives and Mortgage Department personnel at Goldman Sachs.  The
Subcommittee also spoke with agency officials, law enforcement, and industry and academic

In connection with the hearing, the Subcommittee released a joint memorandum from
Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Coburn summarizing the investigation to date into the
role of the investment banks in the financial crisis.   The memorandum contained the following
findings of fact, which this Report reaffirms, regarding the Goldman Sachs case study.

1. Securitizing High Risk Mortgages.  From 2004 to 2007, in exchange for lucrative
fees, Goldman Sachs helped lenders like Long Beach, Fremont, and New Century,
securitize high risk, poor quality loans, obtain favorable credit ratings for the resulting
residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), and sell the RMBS securities to
investors, pushing billions of dollars of risky mortgages into the financial system. 

2. Magnifying Risk.  Goldman Sachs magnified the impact of toxic mortgages on

financial markets by re-securitizing RMBS securities in collateralized debt obligations
(CDOs), referencing them in synthetic CDOs, selling the CDO securities to investors,
and using credit default swaps and index trading to profit from the failure of the same
RMBS and CDO securities it sold. 

3. Shorting the Mortgage Market.  As high risk mortgage delinquencies increased, and

RMBS and CDO securities began to lose value, Goldman Sachs took a net short
position on the mortgage market, remaining net short throughout 2007, and cashed in
very large short positions, generating billions of dollars in gain. 

4. Conflict Between Client Interests and Proprietary Trading.  In 2007, Goldman

Sachs went beyond its role as market maker for clients seeking to buy or sell
mortgage related securities, traded billions of dollars in mortgage related assets for the
benefit of the firm without disclosing its proprietary positions to clients, and
instructed its sales force to sell mortgage related assets, including high risk RMBS
and CDO securities that Goldman Sachs wanted to get off its books, and utilizing key
roles in CDO transactions to promote its own interests at the expense of investors,
creating a conflict between the firm’s proprietary interests and the interests of its
clients. 

5. Abacus Transaction.  Goldman Sachs structured, underwrote, and sold a synthetic
CDO called Abacus 2007-AC1, did not disclose to the Moody’s analyst overseeing
the rating of the CDO that a hedge fund client taking a short position in the CDO had
helped to select the referenced assets, and also did not disclose that fact to other
investors.  

6. Using Naked Credit Default Swaps.  Goldman Sachs used credit default swaps
(CDS) on assets it did not own to bet against the mortgage market through single
name and index CDS transactions, generating substantial revenues in the process.

(2)  Goldman Sachs Background

378

Goldman Sachs was established in 1869 as an investment bank.

1513

partnership, in 1999, it became a publicly traded corporation.  In 2008, it converted to a bank
holding company.  Its headquarters are located in New York City, and the firm manages about
$870 billion in assets.
  Goldman employs about 14,000 employees in the United States and
32,500 worldwide.  In 2007, it reported net revenues of $11.6 billion, of which $3.7 billion was
generated by the Structured Products Group in the Mortgage Department, primarily as a result of
its subprime investment activities.1515

1514

  Originally a private

Unlike other Wall Street banks, Goldman has no retail banking operations.  It does not

accept deposits from, nor lend to, retail customers, nor does its broker-dealer provide advice to or
execute trades on behalf of retail customers.  Goldman provides services only to so-called
“sophisticated” institutional investors, generally large corporations, financial services firms,
pension funds, hedge funds, and a few very wealthy individuals.

1516

 

 For most of its history, Goldman operated exclusively as an investment bank, providing

investment advice to corporate clients, arranging and executing mergers and acquisitions, and
arranging financing for customers through stock and bond offerings.  After the 1999 repeal of the
Glass-Steagall Act, which had restricted the activities that could be engaged in by investment
banks, Goldman expanded its operations.

1517

  

Over the last ten years, traditional investment banking activities have become a small

percentage of Goldman’s business.  Goldman has instead become primarily a Wall Street trading
house, providing broker-dealer services to institutional customers, acting as a prime broker to
hedge funds,
conducting proprietary trading activities for its own benefit.  In the years leading up to the
financial crisis, Goldman became an active investor and participant in the deals and transactions
that it was handling for clients as well as selling to investors.1519

Goldman Sachs Mortgage Department.  In 2006 and 2007, the time period reviewed by

the Subcommittee, the most senior Goldman executives were the Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein; Chief Operating Officer and Co-President Gary Cohn;
Co-President Jon Winkelried; and Chief Financial Officer David Viniar.  Goldman’s Chief Risk
Officer, Craig Broderick, was head of the Market Risk Management & Analysis area of the firm,
which monitored and measured risk for the firm as a whole and for each business unit. 
Goldman’s Treasurer, Sarah Smith, was in charge of the Controllers area of the firm, which was
responsible for financial accounting, profit and loss statements, customer credit, collateral/margin
matters, and position valuation verification.

1520

 

1521

In 2006 and 2007, Goldman Sachs’ operating activities were divided into three segments: 

Investment Banking, Trading and Principal Investments, and Asset Management and Securities
Services.
  The Trading and Principal Investments Segment was divided into three businesses:
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC); Equities; and Principal Investments.
  FICC
had five principal businesses: commodities; credit products; currencies; interest rate products;
and mortgage related securities and loan products and other asset backed instruments.1523

1522

In its mortgage business, Goldman Sachs acted as a market maker, underwriter,

placement agent, and proprietary trader in residential and commercial mortgage related securities,
loan products, and other asset backed and derivative products.
  The Mortgage Department was
responsible for buying and selling virtually all of the firm’s mortgage related assets.  It 
originated and invested in residential and commercial mortgage backed securities; developed,
traded, and marketed structured products and derivatives backed by mortgages; and traded
mortgage market products on exchanges.

1524

1525

  

In 2006 and 2007, the head of the Mortgage Department was Daniel Sparks.  Goldman
Co-Presidents Gary Cohn and Jon Winkelried, as well as CFO David Viniar, had been involved
in Mr. Sparks’ earlier career at Goldman, and he maintained frequent, direct contact with them
regarding the Mortgage Department.

 The Mortgage Department was divided into seven different desks:  (1) the Residential

Whole Loan Trading Desk; (2) the Structured Product Group (SPG) Trading Desk; (3) the CDO
Origination Desk, which also handled collateralized loan obligations (CLOs);  (4) the Structured
Product Syndicate and Asset Backed Security (ABS) Finance Desk;  (5) the Collateralized
Mortgage Obligations (CMO) and Derivatives Desk; (6) the Advisory Group Desk; and (7) the
Commercial Real Estate Loan Trading Desk.

1531

 

The Residential Whole Loan Trading Desk was headed by Kevin Gasvoda.

  It bought
packages of residential whole loans; issued RMBS securities in the subprime, Alt A and prime
categories; originated residential and commercial mortgages; and gave lines of credit to certain
selected mortgage lenders in exchange for direct access to pools of mortgages they originated, in
so-called “conduit” arrangements.

1532

1533

 

1534

The SPG Trading Desk was headed by Michael Swenson.

  It was further subdivided
into three different desks:  the ABS Desk, the Correlation Trading Desk, and the Commercial
Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS) Desk.  The ABS Desk was also headed by Michael
Swenson and traded mainly synthetic asset backed securities, particularly RMBS and CDO
securities and single name CDS contracts related to RMBS and CDOs.  The ABS Desk also had
an important sub-desk called the ABX Trading Desk, which was headed by Joshua Birnbaum,
and traded synthetic mortgage backed securities based on the ABX Index.  The Correlation
Trading Desk was headed by Jonathan Egol.  It structured, marketed, and traded complex
synthetic structured finance products, including a series of 23 CDOs known as Abacus.
  The
1535
CMBS Desk was headed by David Lehman and traded commercial mortgage backed securities. 
With the exception of the Correlation Desk, the SPG Trading Desk was primarily devoted to
“secondary trading,” meaning the buying and selling of pre-existing asset backed securities. The
SPG Trading Desk was also sometimes referred to as the “Mortgage Secondary Trading Desk.”

(3)  Overview of Goldman Sachs Case Study

382

This Report looks at two activities undertaken by Goldman in 2006 and 2007.  The first is
Goldman’s intensive effort, beginning in December 2006 and continuing through 2007, to profit
from the subprime mortgage market collapse, particularly by shorting subprime mortgage assets. 
The second is how, in 2006 and 2007, Goldman used mortgage related CDOs to unload the risk
associated with its faltering high risk mortgage assets onto clients, help a favored client make a
$1 billion gain, and profit from the failure of the very CDO securities it sold to its clients.  

These activities raise questions related to Goldman’s compliance with its obligations to

provide suitable investment recommendations to its clients and disclose its material adverse
interests to potential investors.  They also raise questions about whether some of Goldman’s
incomplete disclosures were deceptive, and whether some of its activities generated conflicts of
interest in which Goldman placed its financial interests before those of its clients.  They also
raise questions about the high risk nature of some structured finance products and their role in
U.S. financial markets.

(a)  Overview of How Goldman Shorted the Subprime Mortgage Market

Beginning in December 2006 and continuing through 2007, Goldman twice built and

profited from large net short positions in mortgage related securities, generating billions of
dollars in gross revenues for the Mortgage Department.  Its first net short peaked at about $10
billion in February 2007, and the Mortgage Department as a whole generated first quarter
revenues of about $368 million, after deducting losses and writedowns on subprime loan and

 peaked in June at $13.9 billion.  As a result of this net short,
the SPG Trading Desk generated third quarter revenues of about $2.8 billion, which were offset
by losses on other mortgage desks, but still left the Mortgage Department with more than $741
million in profits.
generated net revenues of $3.7 billion.
Mortgage Department repeatedly breached its risk limits, and Goldman’s senior management
responded by repeatedly giving the Mortgage Department new and higher temporary risk limits
to accommodate its trading.

indicated that the Mortgage Department was contributing 54% of the firm’s total market risk,
even though it ordinarily contributed only about 2% of its total net revenues.

1550

 

To build its net short positions, Goldman’s Mortgage Department personnel used 

structured finance products to engage in multiple, complex transactions.  Its efforts included
selling high risk loans, RMBS, CDO, ABX, and other mortgage related assets from its inventory
and warehouse accounts; shorting RMBS and CDO securities, either by shorting the assets
themselves or by taking the short side of CDS contracts that referenced them, in order to profit
from their fall in value; and shorting multiple other mortgage backed assets simultaneously,
including different tranches of the ABX Index, tranches of CDOs, and CDS contracts on such
assets.  To lock in its profits after the short assets fell in value, Goldman often entered into
offsetting CDS contracts to “cover its shorts,” as explained below.  Senior Goldman executives
directed and monitored these activities. 

The evidence reviewed by the Subcommittee shows that some of the transactions leading
to Goldman’s short positions were undertaken to advance Goldman’s own proprietary financial
interests and not as a function of its market making role to assist clients in buying or selling
assets.  In the end, Goldman profited from the failure of many of the RMBS and CDO securities
it had underwritten and sold.  As Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein explained in an internal email
to his colleagues in November 2007: “Of course we didn’t dodge the mortgage mess.  We lost
money, then made more than we lost because of shorts.”1551

Covering Shorts to Lock In Profits.  To understand how Goldman profited from its

short positions, it is important to understand references in its internal documents to “covering” or
“monetizing” its shorts.  When Goldman built its short positions, it generally used CDS contracts
to short a variety of mortgage related securities, including individual RMBS and CDO securities
and baskets of 20 RMBS securities identified in the ABX indices.  Goldman’s shorts then gained
or lost value over time, depending upon how the underlying referenced assets performed during
the same period.

Most CDS contracts expire after a specified number of years.  As explained earlier,

during the covered period, the short party makes periodic premium payments to the opposing
long party in the CDO.  The short party is essentially betting that a “credit event” will take place
during the covered period that will result in the long party having to provide it with a large

month.  Subcommittee interview of Craig Broderick (4/9/2010).  See also Philippe Jorion, “Value at Risk: The New

party does not have to wait for a credit event in order to realize a gain on its CDS contract.  

  However, the short

1552

One possible alternative is for the short party simply to sell its short position to another
party for a profit.  If, however, the short party does not want to sell or has no ready buyer, the
short party can still lock in a gain by entering into a second, offsetting CDS contract in which it
takes the long position on an offsetting asset, an action often referred to as “covering the short.” 

In practice, there were several different, technical methods for a party to cover its short
positions.  The simplest example is if the short party bought a $100,000 CDS contract whose
reference asset is a single RMBS security.  Suppose after one month the RMBS security performs
so poorly that the market value of the short position increases to $150,000.  If the short party
wanted to lock in the $50,000 gain, it could do so simply by entering into a new offsetting CDS
contract, referencing the same RMBS security, in which it takes the long position with a new
party who takes the short position at the new higher market value of $150,000.  The result would
be that the original short party would own a short position and a long position that offset each
other, and would lock in the $50,000 difference in value as profit.

During 2007, Goldman executives repeatedly directed the Mortgage Department to

“cover its shorts” and lock in the gains from the increased value of its short positions.  When it
covered its short positions by entering into offsetting contracts, the Mortgage Department
simultaneously “monetized” its short positions – recorded the locked in profit.  That is because,
when it covered a short by entering into an offsetting contract, the Mortgage Department’s
general practice was to record a profit on its books equal to the gain on the original short
position.  Because the original purchase price of the CDS was known and fixed, and the new
higher price obtained in the offsetting transaction was known and fixed, the Mortgage
Department was able to capture the difference between the two prices as profit. 

Going Past Home: The First Net Short.  Because Goldman’s activities were so varied

and complex during the period reviewed, this overview provides a brief summary of the key
events detailed in the following sections.  The review begins in mid to late 2006, when Goldman
realized that the market for subprime mortgage backed securities was beginning to decline, and
the large long positions it held in ABX assets, loans, RMBS and CDO securities, and other
mortgage related assets began to pose a disproportionate risk to both the Mortgage Department

President Gary Cohn, Richard Ruzika criticized the accumulation of the large net long position:  “You know and I
know this position was allowed to get too big – for the liquidity in the market, our infrastructure, and the ability of
our traders.  That statement would be the same even if we had gotten the market direction correct – although the

  While this

   

1555

1554

On December 14, 2006, as Goldman’s mortgage related assets continued to lose value,

Goldman’s Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, held a meeting with key Mortgage Department
personnel and issued instructions for the Department to “get closer to home.”
  By “closer to
home,” Mr. Viniar meant for the Mortgage Department to assume a more neutral risk position,
one that was neither substantially long nor short, but actions taken by the Mortgage Department
in response to his instructions quickly shot past “home,” resulting in Goldman’s first large net
short position in February 2007.1557

1556

The actions taken by the Mortgage Department included selling outright from its

inventory large numbers of subprime RMBS, CDO, and ABX assets, even at a loss, while
simultaneously buying CDS contracts to hedge the long assets remaining in its inventory.  The
Mortgage Department also halted new RMBS securitizations, began emptying its RMBS
warehouse accounts, and generally stopped purchasing new assets for its CDO warehouse
accounts.  It also purchased the short side of CDS contracts referencing the ABX index for a
basket of AAA rated subprime residential loans, as a kind of “disaster insurance” in the event
that even AAA rated mortgages started defaulting. 

Within about a month of the “closer to home” meeting, in January 2007, the Mortgage
Department had largely eliminated or offset Goldman’s long positions on subprime mortgage
related assets.  The Mortgage Department then started to build a multi-billion-dollar short
position to enable the firm to profit from the subprime RMBS and CDO securities starting to lose
value.  By the end of the first quarter of 2007, the Mortgage Department had swung from a $6
billion net long position in December 2006, to a $10 billion net short position in late February

1558

In late February, Goldman’s Operating Committee, a subcommittee of its Firmwide Risk
Committee, became concerned about the size of the $10 billion net short position.  The Firmwide
Risk Committee was co-chaired by Mr. Viniar, and Messrs. Cohn and Blankfein regularly
attended its meetings.
  The concern arose, in part, because the $10 billion net short position
had dramatically increased the Mortgage Department’s Value-at-Risk or “VAR,” the primary
measure Goldman used to compute its risk.  The Committee ordered the Department to lock in its
profits by “covering its shorts,” as explained above.  The Mortgage Department complied by
covering most, but not all, of the $10 billion net short and brought down its VAR.  It then
maintained a relatively lower risk profile from March through May 2007. 

1560

Attempted Short Squeeze.  In May 2007, the Mortgage Department’s Asset Backed

 

1561

Security (ABS) Trading Desk attempted a “short squeeze” of the CDS market that was intended
to compel other market participants to sell their short positions at artificially low prices.
Goldman’s ABS Desk was still in the process of covering the Mortgage Department’s shorts by
offering CDS contracts in which Goldman took the long side.  The ABS Desk devised a plan in
which it would offer those CDS contracts to short parties at lower and lower prices, in an effort
to drive down the overall market price of the shorts.  As prices fell, Goldman’s expectation was
that other short parties would begin to sell their short positions, in order to avoid having to sell at
still lower prices.  The ABS Desk planned to buy up those short positions at the artificially low
prices it had caused, thereby rebuilding its own net short position at a lower cost.
  The ABS
Desk initiated its plan, and during the same period Goldman customers protested the lower
values assigned by Goldman to their short positions as out of line with the market.  Despite the
lower prices, the parties who already held short positions generally kept them and did not try to
sell them.  In June, after learning that two Bear Stearns hedge funds specializing in subprime
mortgage assets might collapse, the ABS Desk abandoned its short squeeze effort and
recommenced buying short positions at the prevailing market prices.

1562

The Big Short.  In mid-June 2007, the two Bear Stearns hedge funds did collapse,

triggering another steep decline in the value of subprime mortgage assets.  In response, Goldman
immediately went short again, to profit from the falling prices.  Within two weeks, Goldman had
massed a large number of CDS contracts shorting a variety of subprime mortgage assets.  On

June 22, 2007, Goldman’s net short position reached its peak of approximately $13.9 billion, as
calculated by the Subcommittee.
  That total included the $9 billion in AAA ABX assets that
Goldman had earlier acquired as “disaster protection,” in case the subprime market as a whole
lost value.  The resulting net short, referred to by Mr. Viniar as the “big short,” was nearly 40%
larger than its first net short which had peaked at $10 billion in February 2007.   

1563

To lock in its profits on the $13.9 billion short, the Mortgage Department began working
to cover its shorts, buying long assets and entering into offsetting CDS contracts in which it took
the long position.  On July 10, 2007, the credit rating agencies issued the first of many mass rating
downgrades that affected hundreds and then thousands of RMBS and CDO securities, whose
values began to fall even more rapidly.
  The Mortgage Department was able to purchase long
assets at a low cost, managed to cover most of its short positions, and locked in its profits.  At the
same time, the Mortgage Department maintained a net short position in higher risk subprime
RMBS securities carrying credit ratings of BBB or BBB-, betting that those securities would lose
still more value and produce still more profits for the firm.  In August, however, Goldman senior
management again became concerned about the size of the Department’s net short position and its
VAR levels, which had reached record levels.  On August 21, 2007, Goldman’s Chief Operating
Officer Gary Cohn ordered the Mortgage Department to “get down now.”

The $3.7 billion in net revenues from the SPG’s short positions helped to offset other

mortgage related losses, and, at year’s end, at a time when mortgage departments at other large
financial institutions were reporting record losses, Goldman’s Mortgage Department reported
overall net revenues of $1.1 billion.

(b)  Overview of Goldman’s CDO Activities 

This Report also examines four CDOs that Goldman originated, underwrote, and marketed

in the years leading up to the financial crisis:  Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1, Anderson Mezzanine
2007-1, Timberwolf I, and Abacus 2007-AC1.  Hudson was conceived in 2006, and issued its
securities in December 2006, as Goldman began its concerted effort to sell its mortgage holdings. 
Anderson, Timberwolf, and Abacus issued their securities in 2007, as RMBS and CDO securities
were losing value, and Goldman was shorting the subprime mortgage market.

During 2007, as Goldman built and profited from its net short positions in the first and
third quarters of the year, it continued to design, underwrite, and sell CDO securities.  Due to
waning investor interest, in February 2007, Goldman conducted a review of the CDOs in its
pipeline.  The Mortgage Department decided to cancel four pending CDOs, downsize another
two, and bring all of its remaining CDOs to market as quickly as possible.  Also in February 2007,
the Mortgage Department limited its CDO Origination Desk to carrying out only the CDO
transactions already underway. 

“Gameplan” for CDO Valuation Project.  In the first quarter of 2007, Goldman’s
Mortgage Department worked to sell the warehouse assets from the discontinued CDOs, the
securities issued by past Goldman-originated CDOs, and the new securities from CDOs being
originated by Goldman in 2006 and 2007.  In May 2007, as CDO sales slowed dramatically,
Goldman became concerned about the lack of sales prices to establish the value of its CDO
holdings.  Goldman needed accurate values, not just to establish its CDO sales prices, but also to
value the CDO securities for collateral purposes and in compliance with Goldman’s policy of
using up-to-date market values for all of its holdings.
  On May 11, 2007, Goldman senior
executives, including Mr. Cohn and Mr. Viniar, Mortgage Department personnel, controllers, and

others held a meeting and developed a “Gameplan” for a CDO valuation project.
Gameplan called for the Mortgage Department, over the course of about a week, to use three
different valuation methods to price all of its CDO warehouse assets, unsold securities from past
CDOs, and new securities from the CDOs currently being marketed to clients.

  The

While the CDO valuation project was underway, Goldman senior executive Thomas

Montag asked Daniel Sparks for an estimate of how much the firm would need to write down the
value of its CDO assets.  Mr. Sparks responded that “the base case from traders is down [$]382
[million].” He  also wrote:  “I think we should take the write-down, but market [the CDO
securities] at much higher levels.”
expressed concern about selling clients CDO securities at one price and then immediately
devaluing them: “[D]on’t think we can trade this with our clients andf [sic] then mark them down
dramatically the next day.”
Broderick told his staff to anticipate deep markdowns and highlighted the need to identify clients
that might suffer financial difficulty if Goldman devalued their CDO securities and demanded
they post more cash collateral. 

  At the same time, Goldman’s Chief Credit Risk Officer Craig

  Another Goldman senior executive, Harvey Schwartz,

1574

On May 20, 2007, the Gameplan results were summarized in an internal presentation.

 
It projected that Goldman would have to take from $248 to $440 million in writedowns on unsold
CDO securities and warehouse assets, making it clear to Goldman executives that its CDO assets
were losing value rapidly.
  In several drafts of the presentation, the Mortgage Department had
also written that Goldman’s CDOs were expected “to underperform,” but that statement was
removed from the final presentation given to senior executives.

Targeted Sales.  The Gameplan also recommended a two-pronged approach to selling the
firm’s remaining CDO assets.  First, it recommended transfer of the CDO warehouse assets to the
Mortgage Department’s SPG Trading Desk for further valuation and sale.  Second, it
recommended that the Mortgage Department use a “targeted” approach to sell off the existing and

and providing a list of another 35 clients as secondary targets.

1579

  

At the same time, Mr. Sparks named David Lehman, a commercial mortgage backed
securities trader, as the new head of the CDO Origination Desk.  Shortly thereafter, Goldman
dismantled the CDO Origination Desk and moved all remaining CDO securities to the SPG
Trading Desk, where he was based.  The SPG Trading Desk, which was a secondary trading desk
and had little experience with underwriting, assumed responsibility for marketing the remaining
unsold Goldman-originated CDO securities.  The SPG Trading Desk’s lack of underwriting
experience meant that it was less familiar with the obligations of underwriters and placement
agents to disclose all material adverse interests to potential investors.

The SPG Trading Desk worked with Goldman’s sales force to market the CDO securities. 
Goldman employed “hard sell” tactics, repeatedly urging its sales force to sell the CDO securities
and target clients with limited CDO familiarity.
  After trying the Gameplan’s “targeted” client
approach during May, June, and July 2007, the Mortgage Department switched back to issuing
sales directives or “axes” to its entire sales force, including sales offices abroad.  Axes on CDOs
generally went out at weekly or monthly intervals, identified specific CDO securities as top sales
priorities, and offered additional financial incentives for selling them.  Despite the CDOs’
declining value, the sales force succeeded in selling some of the CDO securities, primarily to
clients in Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East, but was unable to sell all of them.

1580

The four CDOs that the Subcommittee examined illustrate a variety of conflict of interest

issues related to how Goldman designed, marketed, and administered them. 
  

Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1.  Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1 (Hudson 1) was a $2 billion

synthetic CDO comprised of $1.2 billion in ABX assets from Goldman’s own inventory, and $800
million in single name CDS contracts on subprime RMBS and CDO securities that Goldman
wanted to short.   It was called a “mezzanine” CDO, because the referenced RMBS securities
carried the riskier credit ratings of BBB or BBB-.  Goldman used the CDO to transfer the risk
associated with its ABX assets to investors that bought Hudson 1 securities.  Goldman also took
100% of the short side of the CDO, which meant that it would profit if any of the Hudson
securities lost value.  In addition, Goldman exercised complete control over the CDO by playing
virtually every key role in its establishment and administration, including the roles of underwriter,
initial purchaser of the issued securities, senior swap counterparty, credit protection buyer,
collateral put provider, and liquidation agent.

  See discussions of Hudson, Anderson, Timberwolf, and Abacus sales efforts, below.

391

Goldman began marketing Hudson 1 securities in October 2006, soliciting clients to buy

Hudson securities.  It did not fully disclose to potential investors material facts related to
Goldman’s investment interests, the source of the CDO’s assets, and their pricing.  The Hudson 1
marketing materials stated prominently, for example, that Goldman’s interests were “aligned” with
investors, because Goldman was buying a portion of the Hudson 1 equity tranche.
marketing materials, Goldman did not mention that it was also shorting all $2 billion of Hudson’s
assets – an investment that far outweighed its $6 million equity share and which was directly
adverse to the interests of prospective investors.  In addition, the marketing materials stated that
Hudson 1’s assets were “sourced from the Street” and that it was “not a balance sheet CDO.”
1582
However, $1.2 billion of the Hudson assets had been selected solely to transfer risk from ABX
assets in Goldman’s own inventory.  

  In its

1581

 

Goldman also did not disclose in the materials that it had priced the assets without using

any actual third party sales.  The absence of arm’s length pricing was significant, because the
Hudson CDO was designed to short the ABX Index using single name RMBS securities, and there
was a pricing mismatch between the two types of assets.
  Goldman not only determined the
pricing for the RMBS securities purchased by Hudson 1, but retained the profit from the pricing
differential.  The marketing materials did not inform investors of Goldman’s role in the pricing, the
pricing methodology used, or the gain it afforded to Goldman.  In addition, the marketing materials
stated Hudson 1 was “not a balance sheet” CDO, without disclosing that Hudson had been
designed from its inception to remove substantial risk from Goldman’s balance sheet.  

1583

The Hudson 1 Offering Circular contained language that may have also misled investors

about Goldman’s true investment interest in the CDO.  The Offering Circular stated:

“[Goldman Sachs International] and/or any of its affiliates may invest and/or deal, for their
own respective accounts for which they have investment discretion, in securities or in other
interests in the Reference Entities, in obligations of the Reference Entities or in the obligors
in respect of any Reference Obligations or Collateral Securities ... , or in credit default
swaps ... , total return swaps or other instruments enabling credit and/or other risks to be
traded that are linked to one or more Investments.”

1584

 

This provision seems to inform investors that Goldman “may invest” for its own account in the
CDO’s securities, reference obligations, or CDS contracts, while withholding the fact that, by the
time the Offering Circular had been drafted, Goldman had already determined to take 100% of the
short position in the CDO, an investment which was directly adverse to the interests of Hudson
securities investors.

Once Hudson issued its securities, Goldman placed a priority on selling them, and delayed

the issuance of a CDO on behalf of another client in order to facilitate Hudson sales.  Goldman
sales representatives reported that clients expressed skepticism regarding the quality of the Hudson
assets, but Goldman continued to promote the sale of the CDO.

In 2008, as Hudson’s assets lost value and received rating downgrades from the credit

rating agencies, Goldman, in its role as liquidation agent, was tasked with selling those assets to
limit losses to the long investors.  The major Hudson investor, Morgan Stanley, pressed Goldman
to do just that.  Goldman, however, delayed selling the assets for months.  As the assets dropped in
value, Goldman’s short position increased in value.  Morgan Stanley’s representative reported to a
colleague that when Goldman rejected the firm’s request to sell the poorly performing Hudson
assets, “I broke my phone.”

Anderson Mezzanine 2007-1.  Anderson Mezzanine 2007-1 (Anderson) was another
synthetic CDO referencing BBB and BBB- rated subprime RMBS securities.  It was issued in
March 2007.  Among other roles, Goldman served as the CDO’s placement agent, initial purchaser,
collateral put provider, and liquidation agent.  Goldman hired another firm, a New York hedge
fund founded by former Goldman employees, GSC Partners, to act as the collateral manager. 
Goldman took a short position on approximately 40% of the $305 million in assets underlying
Anderson. 

Anderson referenced a number of poor quality assets.  Those assets had been selected by

GSC Partners, with the approval of Goldman.  Over 45% of the referenced subprime RMBS
securities contained mortgages originated by New Century, a subprime lender known within the
industry, including Goldman, for issuing poor quality loans and which was experiencing financial

  Due to the asset quality problems, the
Mortgage Department head, Daniel Sparks, initially decided to cancel Anderson, but later changed

already in its warehouse account, rather than wait to accumulate all of the $500 million in assets

When Anderson issued its securities in March 2007, Goldman placed a high priority on

selling them, even delaying another CDO – Abacus 2007-AC1 which was being organized at the
request of the Paulson hedge fund – to allow its sales force to concentrate on promoting Anderson. 
Potential investors raised questions about the quality of its underlying assets, especially the New
Century loans, and Goldman provided its sales representatives with talking points to dispel
concerns about the New Century assets.  When one client asked how Goldman had gotten
“comfortable” with the New Century loans, Goldman did not disclose to the client its own negative
views of New Century loans or that it had 40% of the short side of the CDO. 

Goldman marketed Anderson securities to a number of its clients, including pension funds,

Timberwolf I CDO.  Timberwolf I was a $1 billion hybrid CDO  transaction that

referenced single-A rated securities from other CDOs.  Those CDO securities referenced, in turn,
RMBS securities carrying lower credit ratings, primarily BBB.  Altogether, Timberwolf referenced
56 unique CDO securities that had over 4,500 unique underlying assets.  Goldman served as the
CDO’s placement agent, initial purchaser, collateral put provider, and liquidation agent.  It also
hired a hedge fund with former Goldman employees, Greywolf Capital Management, to act as the
collateral manager.  Greywolf selected the CDO’s assets, with Goldman’s approval.  Goldman took
a short position on approximately 36% of the $1 billion in assets underlying Timberwolf.

Timberwolf’s securities began losing value almost as soon as they were purchased.  In
February 2007, Goldman’s Mortgage Department head told a senior executive that Timberwolf
was one of two deals “to worry about.”  He also wrote that the assets in the Timberwolf warehouse
account had declined so much in value that they had already exhausted Greywolf’s responsibility to
pay a portion of any warehouse losses, and any additional losses would be Goldman’s exclusive

 Despite doubts about its performance and asset quality, Goldman engaged in an aggressive
campaign to sell the Timberwolf securities.  As part of its tactics, Mr. Lehman instructed Goldman
personnel not to provide written information to investors about how Goldman was valuing or
pricing the Timberwolf securities, and its sales force offered no additional assistance to potential
investors trying to evaluate the 4,500 underlying assets.  Mr. Sparks and Mr. Lehman sent out
numerous sales directives or “axes” to the Goldman sales force, stressing that Timberwolf was a
priority for the firm.
  In April, Mr. Sparks suggested issuing “ginormous” sales credits to any
salesperson who sold Timberwolf securities, only to find out that large sales credits had already
been offered.
continued to sell the securities at a much higher price than the company knew it was worth.  At one
point, a member of the SPG Trading Desk issued an email to clients and investors, advising them
that the market was rebounding and the downturn was “already a distant memory.”
  Goldman
also began targeting Timberwolf sales to “non-traditional” buyers and those with little CDO
familiarity, such as increasing its marketing efforts in Europe and Asia.  

  In May, while Goldman was internally lowering the value of Timberwolf, it

On June 18, 2007, Goldman sold $100 million worth of Timberwolf securities to an
Australian hedge fund, Basis Capital.  Just 16 days later, on July 4, Goldman informed Basis
Capital that the securities had lost value, and it had to post additional cash collateral to secure its
CDS contract.  On July 12, Goldman told Basis Capital that the value had dropped again, and still
more collateral needed to be posted.  In less than a month, the value of Timberwolf had fallen by
$37.5 million.  Basis Capital posted the additional capital, but soon after declared bankruptcy.   

On June 1, 2007, Goldman Sachs sold $36 million in Timberwolf securities to a Korean life

insurance company, Hungkuk Life, that had little familiarity with the product.  The head of the
Korean sales office said his office was willing to sell the company additional securities, if assured
the office would receive a 7% sales credit.  Goldman agreed, and said “get ‘er done.”  The sales
office sold another $56 million in Timberwolf securities to the life insurance company which paid
$76 per share when Goldman’s internal value for the security was $65.  

Within ten days of that sale, Thomas Montag, a senior Goldman executive, sent an email to

the Mortgage Department head, Daniel Sparks, stating: “boy that timeberwof [Timberwolf] was

Goldman had also arranged for its subsidiary, Goldman Sachs International (GSI), to act as

both the primary CDS counterparty and the collateral put provider in Timberwolf.
GSI received a fee for serving as the collateral put provider, GSI began to refuse to approve
Timberwolf’s purchase of new collateral securities whose values might decline below par value
and put Goldman at risk of having to make up the difference.  Instead, GSI pressured Timberwolf
to keep its collateral in cash, even though an internal Goldman analysis had confirmed that cash
collateral produced lower returns for Timberwolf investors than collateral securities.  When
Greywolf objected to this practice, Goldman backed down and allowed the purchase of a narrow
range of very safe, short term asset backed securities as collateral.

In the fall of 2007, a Goldman analyst provided executives with a price history for

Timberwolf A2 securities.  It showed that, in five months, Timberwolf securities had lost 80% of
their value, falling from $94 in March to $15 in September.  Upon receiving the pricing history, the
Timberwolf deal captain, Matthew Bieber, wrote that March 27 – the day Timberwolf issued its
securities – was “a day that will live in infamy.”

  Timberwolf was liquidated in 2008.

Abacus 2007-AC1.  Abacus 2007-AC1 was a $2 billion synthetic CDO that referenced

BBB rated mid and subprime RMBS securities issued in 2006 and early 2007.  It was a static CDO,
meaning once selected, its reference obligations did not change.  It was the last in a series of 16
Abacus CDOs that referenced primarily mortgage backed assets and were designed by Goldman. 
Those Abacus CDOs were known as single tranche CDOs, structures pioneered by Goldman to
provide customized CDOs for clients interested in assuming a specific type and amount of
investment risk. They enabled the client to select the assets, the size of the investment, the amount
of subordination or cushion before the securities would be exposed to loss, and could be issued
with a single tranche.
  The Abacus CDOs also enabled investors to short a selected group of
RMBS or CDO securities at the same time.  Goldman used the Abacus CDOs not only to sell short
positions to investors, but also as a way for Goldman itself to short mortgage assets in bulk.1602

1601

  6/2007 Goldman internal email to Daniel Sparks, Hearing Exhibit 4/27-105.
  In synthetic CDOs, the cash proceeds from the sales of the CDO securities were used to purchase “collateral

1598

debt securities.”  Later, when cash was needed to make payments to a long or short party, those collateral securities
were sold, and the cash was used to make the payments.  In the event the collateral securities used to pay the short
party (called “default swap collateral”) could not be sold for face (par) value, Goldman, the short party, absorbed the
loss, effectively serving as the default swap collateral put provider.  For more information, see discussion of

Abacus 2007-AC1 was the first and only Abacus transaction in which Goldman allowed a

third party client to essentially “rent” its CDO structure and play a direct, principal role in the
selection of the assets.  Goldman did not itself intend to invest in  the CDO.
  Instead, it
functioned primarily as an agent, earning fees for its roles in structuring, underwriting, and
administering the CDO.  Those roles included Goldman’s acting as the placement agent, collateral
securities selection agent, and collateral put provider.  Unlike previous Abacus CDOs, Goldman
employed a third party to serve as the portfolio selection agent, essentially using that agent to
promote sales and mask the role of its client in the asset selection process.

1603

Goldman originated Abacus 2007-AC1 in response to a request by Paulson & Co. Inc.
(Paulson), a hedge fund that was among Goldman’s largest customers for subprime mortgage
related assets. Paulson had a very negative view of the mortgage market, which was publicly
known, and wanted Goldman’s assistance in structuring a transaction that would allow it to take a
short position on a portfolio of subprime mortgage assets that it believed were likely to perform
poorly or fail.  Goldman allowed Paulson to use the Abacus CDO for that purpose.  In entering into
that arrangement with Paulson and simultaneously acting as the placement agent responsible for
marketing the Abacus securities to long investors, Goldman created a conflict of interest between
itself and the investors it would be soliciting to buy the Abacus securities.  

Paulson established a set of criteria to select the reference assets for the Abacus CDO to

1604

  After establishing those parameters, Paulson worked with the

achieve its investment objective.
actual portfolio section agent to select the assets.  Documents show that Paulson proposed,
substituted, rejected, and approved assets for the reference portfolio.  Goldman was aware of
Paulson’s investment objective, the role it played in the selection of the reference assets, and the
fact that the selection process yielded a set of poor quality assets.  Of the final set of 90 assets
referenced in the Abacus CDO portfolio, 49 had been initially proposed by Paulson.  Yet Goldman
did not publicly disclose the central role played by Paulson in the asset selection process or the fact
that the economic interest held by an entity actively involved in the asset selection process was
adverse to the interest of investors who would be taking the long position. 

ACA Management LLC, the company hired by Goldman to serve as the portfolio selection

agent, told the Subcommittee that, while it knew Paulson was involved, it was unaware of
Paulson’s true economic interest in the CDO.  The ACA Managing Director who worked on the
Abacus transaction stated that ACA believed that Paulson was going to invest in the equity tranche
of the CDO, thus aligning its interests with those of ACA and other investors.

  As collateral put provider, which it performed for a fee, Goldman did carry risk in the Abacus 2007-AC1

transaction.  In addition, shortly before the Abacus 2007-AC1 transaction closed, Goldman agreed to take the long
side of a CDS contract on the performance of a small portion of the underlying assets when Paulson wanted to
increase its short position at the last minute.  Goldman tried to find an investor to assume its small long position, but
was unable to do so.

parent company both acquired long positions in the Abacus CDO as did a third investor.  The
Abacus securities lost value soon after purchase.  The three long investors together lost more than
$1 billion, while Paulson, the sole short investor, recorded a corresponding profit of about $1
billion.  Today, the Abacus securities are worthless.  

In addition to not disclosing the asset selection role and investment objective of the Paulson
hedge fund, Goldman did not disclose to investors how its own economic interest was aligned with
Paulson.  In addition to accepting a sizable placement fee paid by Paulson for marketing the CDO
securities, Goldman had entered into a side arrangement with the hedge fund in which it would
receive additional fees from Paulson for arranging CDS contracts tied to the Abacus CDO that
included low premium payments falling within a specified range.
  While those lower premium
payments would benefit Paulson by lowering its costs, and benefit Goldman by providing it with
additional fees, they would also reduce the amount of cash being paid into the CDO,
disadvantaging the very investors to whom Goldman was marketing the Abacus securities. 
Goldman nevertheless entered into the arrangement, contrary to the interests of the long investors
in Abacus, and failed to disclose the existence of the fee arrangement in the Abacus marketing
materials. 

1606

On April 16, 2010, the SEC filed a complaint against Goldman and one of the lead

salesmen for the Abacus CDO, Fabrice Tourre, alleging they had failed to disclose material adverse
information to potential investors and committed securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of
the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.  On July 14, 2010, Goldman reached a settlement with the SEC, admitting:

“[T]he marketing materials for the ABACUS 2007-AC1 transaction contained incomplete
information.  In particular, it was a mistake for the Goldman marketing materials to state
that the reference portfolio was ‘selected by’ ACA Management LLC without disclosing
the role of Paulson & Co. Inc. in the portfolio selection process and that Paulson’s
economic interests were adverse to CDO investors.”

1607

  

Goldman agreed to pay a $550 million fine. 

The Hudson, Anderson, Timberwolf, and Abacus CDOs provide concrete details about how

Goldman designed, marketed, and administered mortgage related CDOs in 2006 and 2007.  The
four CDOs also raise questions about whether Goldman complied with its obligations to offer
suitable investments that it believed would succeed, and provide full disclosure to investors of
material adverse interests. They also illustrate a variety of conflicts of interest in the CDO
transactions that Goldman resolved by placing its financial interests and favored clients before
those of its other clients.

Each of the four CDOs examined by the Subcommittee presents conflict of interest

concerns and elements of deception related to how information about the CDO was presented to
investors, including disclosures related to the relevant CDO’s asset selection process, the quality
and value of the CDO’s assets and securities, and the nature and size of Goldman’s proprietary
financial interests.  The Subcommittee’s investigation raises questions regarding whether Goldman
complied with its obligations to disclose material information to investors, including its material
adverse interests, and to refrain from making investment recommendations that are unsuitable for
any investor by recommending financial instruments designed to lose value and perform poorly.  A
key issue underlying much of this analysis is the structuring of and disclosures related to financial
instruments that enable an investment bank to bet against the very financial products it is selling to
clients. 

(4)  How Goldman Shorted the Subprime Mortgage Market

Having provided an overview of Goldman’s shorting activities and CDO activities in the

years leading up to the financial crisis, this next section of the Report provides detailed information
about how Goldman shorted the subprime mortgage market.

(a)  Starting $6 Billion Net Long

By mid-2006, Goldman’s Mortgage Department had a predominantly pessimistic view of

the U.S. subprime mortgage market.   According to Michael Swenson, head of the Mortgage
Department’s Structured Products Group:  “[D]uring the early summer of 2006 it was clear that the
market fundamentals in subprime and the highly levered nature of CDOs [were] going to have a
very unhappy ending.”

   

1608

$6 Billion Long.  In mid-2006, Goldman held billions of dollars in long subprime

mortgage related securities, in particular the long side of CDS contracts referencing the ABX
Index.  In September 2006, Mortgage Department head Daniel Sparks and his superior, Jonathan
Sobel, initiated a series of meetings with Mr. Swenson, head of the Structured Products Group
(SPG), and Mr. Birnbaum, the Mortgage Department’s top trader in ABX assets, to discuss the
Department’s long holdings.
  In those meetings, they discussed whether the Asset Backed
Security (ABS) Trading Desk within SPG should get out of its existing positions or “double-
down.”   After the first meeting, Mr. Birnbaum emailed Mr. Swenson:

‘distressed’ expertise would be more (not less) interesting to investors”).  See also Section 5(a)(iii) below regarding
Goldman executives’ negative views of the market for subprime mortgages and subprime mortgage backed
securities.

“Sobel and Sparks want to know if we should exit or double down.  We double down if we
have a structured place to go with the risk. ...  [W]e are going to sit down with the CDO
guys and talk about a deal.”

1610

  

If the Department’s existing long positions could be transferred off SPG’s books by finding a
“structured place to go with the risk,” the ABS Trading Desk would then be free to “double down”
by taking on new positions and risk. 

That same month, September 2006, the ABS and CDO Desks reached agreement on
constructing a new CDO to provide the ABS Desk with a “structured exit” from some of its
existing investments.  The result was Hudson Mezzanine 2007-1, a CDO designed by Goldman to
transfer to Hudson investors the risk associated with $1.2 billion in net long ABX assets then in
Goldman’s inventory.  The Hudson CDO was also designed to allow Goldman to short $800
million in RMBS securities to offset a portion of its long ABX assets.

1611

  

In December 2006, even after the $2 billion Hudson CDO was constructed, the Mortgage
Department calculated that it still had a $6 billion net long position in subprime mortgage related
assets.

  Goldman’s ABX holdings continued to be a major source of its long assets.

“reference obligation,” without physically purchasing or holding any of the RMBS securities in the
underlying basket.  Because the ABX Index itself was synthetic, and did not depend upon the
acquisition of large blocks of RMBS securities, it enabled an unlimited number of investors to
make unlimited bets on the performance of a group of subprime RMBS securities, using
standardized contracts that could be bought and sold.   The ABX Index also made it economical for
investors to short subprime RMBS securities in bulk.1614

 Kamilla 2007 Review at 19.  In 2007, Mr. Kamilla was named a Managing Partner at Goldman.
  Daniel Sparks, the Mortgage Department head, viewed Mr. Birnbaum as a talented trader, writing in October

subprime mortgage market, and favored the firm’s building a net short position.
during 2006, Goldman’s overall ABX position was net long, not net short.

1622

  However,

401

Goldman was net long because, as a market maker that helped launch the ABX Index in

2006, it facilitated ABX trades for a number of clients, and many of those clients – primarily hedge
funds – went almost exclusively short, requiring Goldman to take the opposing long side of the
CDS contracts referencing the ABX indices.
   These transactions enabled Goldman to amass a
30-40% market share in ABX trading during its first year of existence.  But by mid-2006, they had
also contributed to the Mortgage Department’s net long position in subprime mortgage related
assets.  When the mortgage market began showing signs of strain in the second half of 2006, the
risks associated with the firm’s net long ABX position became more of a concern.

  Subcommittee interview of Joshua Birnbaum (4/22/2010).  Throughout 2006, Mr. Birnbaum was also working
to develop a new product for Goldman, a suite of home price derivatives that would track the Case/Schiller Home
Price Indices.  Like the ABX Index, a derivative product tracking the Case/Schiller Indices would enable investors to
bet on the rise or fall in home prices in various U.S. markets, and provide another vehicle to short the mortgage
market.  See 12/18/2006 New Product Memorandum, “Launch of US Property Derivatives Trading,” GS MBS-E-
013492538.  In May 2006, Mr. Swenson forwarded an email to Mr. Birnbaum about another financial firm seeking
to develop the same type of home price derivatives as Mr. Birnbaum.  A note with the email said: “FYI–The cat is
crawling out of the bag,” meaning that other firms were thinking about launching similar products.  See 5/16/2006
email from Michael Swenson to Joshua Birnbaum, “Housing Futures and Options,” GS MBS-E-016087363.
Goldman offered the new U.S. property derivatives briefly in 2007, but they did not develop significant trading
volumes.  Subcommittee interview of Joshua Birnbaum (10/1/2010).
1623
  The ABX Index began trading in January 2006.  Goldman’s position in the ABX Index was flat when the Index
debuted, but became long and grew considerably longer in the fall of 2006.  See, e.g., 10/17/2006-10/18/2006 email
exchange between Daniel Sparks and Tom Montag, “3 things,” GS MBS-E-010917469; 3/1/2007 email from Daniel
Sparks, “Dinner,” GS MBS-E-002356757, Hearing Exhibit 4/27-143 (“Most of the synthetic flows were hedge funds
getting short and CDO vehicles getting long.”).  Goldman executives also told the Subcommittee that the firm often
took the long side of ABX transactions in which hedge funds were going short.  Subcommittee interview of Daniel
Sparks (4/15/2010); Subcommittee interview of David Viniar (4/13/2010).  See also, e.g., 8/10/2006 email from
Goldman salesperson, “Paulson bookings,” GS MBS-E-012395893 (“GS sold 550mm protection on ABX.HE.A 06-

day 1 [of the ABX Index] and throughout 2006”).
1624
  Mr. Birnbaum’s acquisition of a large net long position in the ABX was viewed negatively by Goldman senior
executives.  When Mr. Sparks recommended Mr. Birnbaum for a promotion to managing director in October 2006,
Mr. Montag responded:  “Josh slipped a bit with the abx position etc.  Is that appropriate.”  Mr. Sparks replied: 
“Josh ... has had a rough couple of months.  But he has handled it very well and is a key person for our franchise.  I
don’t think those 2 months should confuse his value to the firm.”  10/17/2006 email exchange between Daniel Sparks
and Tom Montag, “3 things,” GS MBS-E-010917469.  Mr. Birnbaum was named a managing director later that
month, but Mr. Montag again raised the issue of his net long ABX position when Mr. Sparks sought to allow Mr.
Birnbaum to continue buying equity put options on companies with subprime exposure.  Mr. Montag wrote: 
“Unfortunately trader josh has not demonstrated a track record of controlling his position. ...  Instead of these lousy
hedges he should just be selling his position.”  3/21/2007 email chain between Tom Montag and Daniel Sparks, GS

be the same even if we had gotten the market direction correct –although the vultures would not be circling.”).

Goldman executives expressed the view that the subprime mortgage related market was likely to
get much worse, and the firm should prepare for it.1625

In December 2006, Goldman used the Hudson CDO to transfer the risk associated with

$1.2 billion of its ABX long holdings to Hudson investors.  But even after this transfer, Goldman
still had billions of dollars in long ABX holdings on its books.

Goldman’s Long Mortgage Holdings.  In addition to its long ABX holdings, the

Mortgage Department’s $6 billion net long position in December 2006 was due to a large inventory
of RMBS, CDO, and other mortgage related assets in Goldman’s investment and sale inventories
and in its CDO warehouses.  In 2006, the Mortgage Department conducted numerous RMBS and
CDO securitizations that required it to acquire and repackage whole loans, RMBS and CDO
securities, and other mortgage related assets.  When assembling CDOs, Goldman often worked
with third party partners.  These strategic partners bought a portion of the equity and bore some of
the risk of loss in the CDO.  The partners were generally smaller financial firms, such as hedge
funds or asset managers with expertise in CDOs or a particular asset class.  For a fee, the partners
also sometimes served as a CDO’s collateral manager, helping to select the assets.

1626

 

Peter Ostrem, who was head of the CDO Origination Desk from 2006 until May 2007, was

aware of substantial problems in the subprime mortgage market, but believed that the market
distress was temporary and the market would stabilize.
  Mr. Ostrem wanted to continue to
increase the CDO Desk’s business by producing as many marketable CDOs as possible.
  Darryl
Herrick, who worked for Mr. Ostrem on the CDO Origination Desk expressed the view that hedge
funds were shorting only the worst CDOs:  “[CDO] shelves people are shorting are enhanced
garbage.”

billions of dollars in assets, which the CDO Origination Desk and its partners had to locate and
acquire, a process called “ramping” that averaged six to nine months per CDO.

Street,” or took them from their own inventory of assets.

1631

When assembling a CDO, Goldman generally opened an internal “warehouse account” for

1632

the CDO in which it stored the acquired assets until a target amount was achieved, and the CDO
was brought to market.  While the assets were in the warehouse account, they were included in
Goldman’s warehouse balance sheet and contributed to its long or short positions.   When the bulk
of the target assets were acquired for a particular CDO, perhaps 75% to 95% of the total, in some
cases Goldman priced the CDO securities and began selling them to clients who were told what the
remaining assets would likely be.
  When a CDO transaction “closed” and its securities were
issued, Goldman transferred the relevant assets from its warehouse account to the corporation or
trust established for the CDO.
   The CDO entity then housed the long assets that had been on
Goldman’s warehouse books, and Goldman was left with a corresponding short position which it
could keep or sell to the CDO’s short parties.
 

  For example, as of March 16, 2007, Goldman calculated that its CDO warehouses

In 2006 and early 2007, since it was often acquiring assets for several CDOs at once, the
CDO Desk generally had a substantial net long position in subprime assets in its CDO warehouse
accounts.
contained $4.7 billion in mortgage related assets.
  After deducting potential liabilities assumed
by Goldman’s partners and making other adjustments, Goldman calculated that it had $2.3 billion
in net long warehouse risk.
  In early 2007, Goldman executives began to express concern about
the risks posed by the subprime mortgage related assets in the CDO warehouse accounts.

On December 7, 2006, Daniel Sparks, the Mortgage Department head, exchanged emails

with Goldman senior executive Thomas Montag about why Goldman was not doing more to
reduce the firm’s risk associated with its net long positions.
  On the same day, Mr. Montag
complained to CFO David Viniar about the Mortgage Department’s lack of aggressiveness in
trying to reduce its net long ABX position:

1638

“[O]n ABX having numerous conversations–I don’t think we should panic out but we
certainly didn’t do a good job of keeping pressure on ... makes me mad because they should
have kept doing it ugh.”1639

The next week, Mr. Viniar called a meeting with the Mortgage Department to discuss its holdings.

(b)  Going Past Home: Goldman’s First Net Short 

CFO David Viniar told the Subcommittee that, in early December 2006, he received reports

   

showing that the Mortgage Department had lost money on ten successive days.

Viniar Meeting.  On December 14, 2006, Mr. Viniar convened a meeting in the conference
room next to his office on the 30th floor, in which he and other senior Goldman executives met for
several hours with Mortgage Department managers, as well as representatives from Market Risk
Management & Analysis and from the Controllers group.
Goldman executives conducted an in-depth review of the Mortgage Department’s holdings.  Mr.
Viniar concluded the Mortgage Department’s position in subprime mortgage related assets was too
long, and its risk exposure was too great.

  At the meeting, Mr. Viniar and other

Mr. Viniar and others told the Subcommittee that Mr. Viniar’s basic message to the

Mortgage Department at the December meeting was not necessarily to go short, but instead to “get
closer to home.”

short the mortgage market.  In addition, the email exchange indicates that Goldman had previously done $7 billion in
transactions with the Paulson hedge fund, but had not done much with the hedge fund recently.  Mr. Sparks wrote:
“They had asked us to do another tranched protection trade for them, and seem fine with it being pushed to January.”

that is neither significantly short nor long.
  Mr. Viniar told the Subcommittee that, by telling the
Mortgage Department to “get closer to home,” he meant that it should assume a more neutral risk
position.
  One way to “get closer to home” was for the Department to sell its long assets. 
Another way to achieve a more neutral risk position was for the Department to take new short
positions to offset its existing long positions.1646

1644

1645

Internal documents indicate that the directions given to the Mortgage Department in the

December meeting were more detailed than the general instruction to “get closer to home.”  In an
email sent on the same day by Mr. Sparks to Goldman executives Messrs. Montag and Ruzika
entitled, “Subprime risk meeting with Viniar/McMahon Summary,” Mr. Sparks wrote:

“Followups:  
1.  Reduce exposure, sell more ABX index outright, basis trade of index vs. CDS too large.
2.  Distribute as much as possible on bonds created from new loan securitizations and clean
previous positions.
3.  Sell some more resid[ual]s
4.  Mark [the value of assets in] the CDO warehouse more regularly ...
5.  Stay focused on the credit of the originators we buy loans from and lend to
6.  Stay focused and aggressive on MLN [Mortgage Lending Network] (warehouse
customer and originator we have EPDs [early payment defaults] to that is likely to fail)
7.  Be ready for the good opportunities that are coming (keep powder dry and look around
the market hard).”

1647

 

The next day, December 15, 2006, Mr. Montag forwarded Mr. Sparks’ email to Mr. Viniar

  Mr. Viniar replied:  “Yes.”  Mr. Viniar noted:

asking: “is this a fair summary?”

1648

“On ABX, the position is reasonably sensible but is just too big.  Might have to spend a
little to size it appropriately.  On everything else my basic message was let’s be aggressive
distributing things because there will be very good opportunities as the markets [go] into

  Id.  In terms of risk reduction, taking on offsetting short positions to reduce long positions does not necessarily
offer the same degree of certainty of risk protection as simply selling off the long assets.  In many cases, the offsets
may not perfectly match, leaving some degree of risk exposure known as “basis risk.”  See, e.g., 2/12/2007 email
from Mr. Sobel to Mr. Cohn, “Post today,” GS MBS-E-009763506 (“Risk that concerns me is basis between ABX

is no est[imated] loss in the basis risk.  Big wildcard.  They [the traders] think they have correlation right and moves

what is likely to be even greater distress and we want to be in a position to take advantage
of them.”1649

In response to the Viniar meeting, the Mortgage Department took immediate action.  It

began selling its long ABX positions outright when possible and entering into large single name
CDS shorts to offset its remaining long assets.  Goldman personnel developed a chart depicting the
long positions the Mortgage Department had taken on BBB and  BBB- rated ABX assets.
  This
chart also showed how quickly the Mortgage Department moved after the Viniar meeting to offset
those long positions by amassing single name RMBS and CDS short positions.

Within about a month, in January 2007, the Mortgage Department had largely eliminated or offset
its long subprime mortgage assets, but it didn’t stop there.  In January and February, the Mortgage
Department began building a multi-billion-dollar short position as part of a plan by the SPG
Trading Desk to profit from the subprime RMBS and CDO securities starting to lose value.  The
plan was discussed with Mr. Sparks and Mr. Ruzika before it was set in motion.  By the end of
February 2007, the Department had swung from a $6 billion net long position to a $10 billion net
short position, a $16 billion reversal in the span of two months.

Selling Assets Outright.  On December 14, 2006, the same day as the Viniar meeting,

Kevin Gasvoda, head of the Residential Whole Loan Trading group, instructed his staff to begin
selling the RMBS securities in Goldman’s inventory, focusing on RMBS securities issued from
Goldman-originated securitizations.  He urged them to “move stuff out” even at a loss:

“[P]ls refocus on retained new issue bond positions and move them out. ... [W]e don’t want
to be hamstrung based on old inventory.  Refocus efforts and move stuff out even if you
have to take a small loss.”1651

In February 2007, to further encourage sales, Mr. Gasvoda issued a sales directive or “axe” to the
Goldman sales force to sell the remaining RMBS securities from Goldman-originated RMBS
securitizations.  On February 9, 2007, the sales force reported a substantial number of sales, and
Mr. Gasvoda replied: “Great job syndicate and sales, appreciate the focus.”

1652

 

In February 2007, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein personally reviewed the Mortgage
Department’s efforts to reduce its subprime RMBS whole loan, securities, and residual equity
positions, asking Mr. Montag:  “[W]hat is the short summary of our risk and the further
writedowns that are likely[?]”

  After a short report from Mr. Montag, Mr. Blankfein replied:

1653

“[Y]ou refer to losses stemming from residual positions in old deals.  Could/should we
have cleaned up these books before and are we doing enough right now to sell off cats and
dogs in other books throughout the division?”1654

At the end of February, Goldman’s controllers prepared a summary of the changes in

Goldman’s RMBS and whole loan inventory since December 2006, and reported:

“Residential Credit Loans:  The overall loans inventory decreased from $11bn to $7bn. ... 
subprime loans decreased from $6.3bn to $1.5bn, Second Liens decreased from $1.5bn to
$0.7bn and S&D [scratch and dent] Loans remained unchanged at $0.8bn.”1655

This analysis indicates that, in less than three months, Goldman had reduced its subprime loan
inventory by over two-thirds, and its second lien inventory by half.  

The Mortgage Department reduced its inventory, not only by selling assets outright, but

also by reducing its purchase of whole loans and securitization efforts.  In March 2007, Goldman
informed its Board of Directors and the SEC that it had stopped purchasing subprime loans and
RMBS securities through, in its words, the use of “conservative bids.”
presentations did not explain the phrase “conservative bids,” an email to Goldman’s Chief Credit
Officer, Craig Broderick, discussing a March 2007 presentation to Goldman’s Audit Committee
about the subprime mortgage business, was much more explicit:  “Just fyi not for the memo, my
understanding is that the desk is no longer buying subprime.  (We are low balling on bids).”
 
1657
Still another method to reduce its loan inventory was an ongoing effort by the Mortgage
Department to return defaulted or fraudulent loans to the lenders from which it had purchased
them.

   While those

On April 23, 2007, Mr. Gasvoda reported to Messrs. Montag and Sparks a dramatic

reduction in Goldman’s inventory of subprime loans and RMBS securities: 

“[W]e have $180mm in loans (unsecuritized) and $255mm of residuals off old deals.  The
$180mm of loans is the smallest we’ve been since we started the business in 2002.  We had
been running at an average loan position balance in subprime of around $4B . ...  The
$255mm we have retained is from deals dating back to 2002 and while we’ve developed
some buying partners, it is not a deep market.  These have been intentional principal
retained positions.”1658

The subprime loan balance of $180 million was just over one-tenth of the $1.5 billion total
Goldman had held at the end of February 2007, reflecting a reduction in its subprime inventory
over a two-month span by nearly 90%.  Overall, the $180 million loan balance was down from an
average subprime loan position balance of $4 billion, which was a 95% reduction in overall
subprime loan inventory levels.

Building the First Short Position.  At the same time the Residential Whole Loan Trading
Desk was selling loans and RMBS securities, the Structured Product Group (SPG) Trading Desk
was working to sell its inventory of long CDS contracts linked to the ABX indices.
  At first, in
December and January, because so many market participants were going short, the SPG’s ABX
Trading Desk found its long ABX positions difficult to sell.
  The ABS Desk then decided to
offset the long ABX assets in part by purchasing the short side of single name CDS contracts on
certain RMBS and CDO securities.
  Within about six weeks, by February 2007, the ABS Desk
had acquired a huge net short position in single name CDS contracts referencing RMBS and CDO
securities that totaled more than $5 billion.  By then, the ABX market had stabilized somewhat,
and the ABS Desk was able to sell outright more of its long ABX positions.  Rather than slow
down once its $6 billion long position was offset, however, the ABS Desk used CDS contracts to
short RMBS and CDO securities “at every opportunity,” in the words of one trader, going
increasingly net short.

positions, the SPG Desk was incurring a very large amount of basis risk – the risk of a mismatch between the
offsetting assets.  Mr. Sparks and other senior Goldman executives wanted to reduce that basis risk by paring the
positions down on both sides – selling the long assets and covering the short assets.  The SPG Desk was not,
however, making the progress Mr. Sparks wanted to see in reducing the basis risk.  On January 23, 2007, Mr. Sparks
wrote to Messrs. Swenson, Birnbaum, and Lehman:

“It does not look like you made any progress on the things we discussed – I want a plan and daily reports on
progress.  Not to be difficult, but if you 3 are too busy I can add someone who can focus on the issue.  My
other concern is I want to stay nimble, and not get too wedded to one way positions – getting massively
short could be more painful than what we have experienced.”

1/23/2007 email from Daniel Sparks, GS MBS-E-010267341.  A week later, Mr. Swenson requested a meeting with
Mr. Sparks and Mr. Ruzika to discuss the difficulties the traders were encountering in reducing the basis risk.  He
wrote:  “I want to go over the facts of what we are up against.”  1/30/2007 email from Michael Swenson to David

On February 12, 2007, Mr. Sparks reported to senior management on the Mortgage
Department’s progress and the substantial profits that its new net short position was already
showing:

“(1)  +20mm [million] P&L [profit and loss] today.
Secondary trading desk is net short risk in the form of single names and structured index vs
index longs (some index shorts also).  Large move down again today ....

(2)  Possible significant upside in book.
The desk has been moving [marking down] single names about 1/3 of what they feel the
correct correlation [to ABX Index] is (around 70%) ....  As the market has moved so much
one way, there is the potential for the book to currently have significant upside embedded
in it.1663

(3)  Loan & resid[ual] books flat [i.e., already hedged].”

1664

 

  The reference to 70% in the email involves correlation assumptions.  Correlation trading depends upon

1663
assumptions about the relative values between one asset (such as a CDS contract referencing the ABX Index) and
another (such as a CDS contract referencing a single RMBS security).  A correlation value of 100% means that the
values of both assets move together in the same amounts.  With 100% correlation, a 10% decline in the value of one
asset implies a 10% decline in the value of the other.  The correlation ratios between different assets are a matter of
the trading desk’s informed judgment.  As one Goldman mortgage trader noted:  “We should discuss base
correlations live . . . there is no market standard for calculating them.”  3/26/2007 email from SPG Trading to
Goldman London, “ABX – TABX : Request from [customer],” GS MBS-E-021893369.  Once a correlation ratio
was set, however, the general practice at Goldman was to change correlation ratios only upon a showing of
observable market trade prices supporting the change.  Traders, thus, engaged in frequent discussions of
“observability.”  A change in correlation ratios could result in an immediate markdown or markup of particular
positions, which could effect Goldman’s profit and loss calculations, collateral calls, and the value of individual
customer positions.

In his February 12 email, Mr. Sparks wrote that the SPG Desk had been marking down the value of single

name long CDS contracts by only one-third of the amount that would apply if the desk’s true calculation of the
correlation between single name and ABX CDS contracts was correct  –  that the two products were more closely
correlated than the market recognized.  Mr. Swenson told the Subcommittee that, in late 2006 and early 2007, single
name long CDS contracts were trading at higher prices than similar ABX CDS contracts, and the observable market
prices of single name CDS contracts were not falling as quickly as market professionals thought they should. 
Subcommittee interview of Michael Swenson (4/16/2010).  Nonetheless, in a steeply declining market, Goldman’s
Mortgage Department assumed that the single name long CDS contracts would eventually fall to the same low values
as the long ABX contracts.  If that happened, since the SPG Desk was net short single name CDS contracts, the
anticipated drop in value would result in an equivalent amount of profit for the desk’s short position – hence, Mr.
Sparks’ reference to the “upside embedded in” the book.

On February 14, 2007, the Mortgage Department actually captured that upside by changing its correlation
assumptions to recognize a higher correlation between single name CDS and ABX CDS contracts.  Using the new
assumptions, Goldman then marked down the value of its customers’ single name CDS contracts to levels closer to
the ABX Index assets.  As the short party to those same CDS contracts, Goldman also realized a profit of $100
million in a single day.  See 2/14/2007 email from Arbind Jha to Michael Swenson, “Mortgages Estimate
REVISED,” GS MBS-E-012474685.

On February 14, 2007, Mr. Sparks again reported to senior management on the

Department’s progress, describing how it was neutralizing its net long position:

412

“[O]ur risk reduction program consisted of:  (1) selling index outright (2) buying single
name protection and (3) buying protection on super-senior portions of the BBB/BBB-
index. ... That is good for us position-wise, bad for accounts who wrote that protection ...
but could hurt our CDO pipeline position as CDOs will be harder to do.”

1665

  

“Overall,” Mr. Sparks wrote, “as a business we are selling our longs and covering our shorts.”1666

With respect to market conditions, Mr. Sparks reported:  

“Subprime environment – bad and getting worse.  Everyday is a major fight for some aspect
of the business (think whack-a-mole).  Trading position has basically squared ... plan to
play from short side.  Loan business is long by nature and goal is to mitigate.  Credit issues
are worsening on deals and pain is broad (including investors in certain GS-issued deals). 
Distressed opportunities will be real, but we aren’t close to that time yet.”1667

In order to “play from the short side,” the Mortgage Department continued building a net

Mr. Birnbaum provided a detailed explanation of his reasons for recommending that the SPG Desk go “VERY
short”:  “(1) Given how much ABX we had purchased through the broker market in 2006, the world would think GS
was very long for the foreseeable future.  We could use that fear to our advantage if we could flip our risk, (2) After
unsuccessfully trying to sell our long to some of [a Goldman salesperson’s] accounts, I realized traditional distressed
buyers were no more likely to buy ABX at 85, 75, 65, etc. than at 95.  The cash flow was just too binary, so there
would be little support if negative momentum began, (3) The fundamentals for mortgage credit were undeniably
deteriorating, (4) CDO managers were in denial ... [their positive market] sentiments would allow us to amass large
amounts of cheap single name protection if we desired, and (5) If the market truly tanked, the already large CDO
warehouses would have to liquidate, further exacerbating the move and ultimately allowing us to cover.”  Id.

large short position in single name CDS contracts referencing RMBS and CDO securities to offset
the Department’s remaining ABX long position:

“After socializing the plan with [Daniel] Sparks and ultimately [Richard] Ruzika, we
implemented the plan by hitting on almost [every] single name CDO protection buying
opportunity in a 2-month period.  Much of the plan began working by February when the
market dropped 25 points and our profitable year was underway.”1671

By clearing the plan with Mr. Sparks and Mr. Ruzika first, SPG Trading Desk informed

senior management of its intent to use the firm’s capital to build the net short position.  Mr.
Birnbaum also wrote:  

“When we were socializing our plan to get short in the beginning of the year, I put together
a tool . . . quantifying our position risk and the p&l [profit and loss] under various market
level scenarios.  I believe this was key for senior management to gain confidence that we
were taking controlled and quantifiable risk that was well understood.”

   

1672

The Mortgage Department’s lead trader in single name CDS contracts referencing RMBS
securities, Deeb Salem, also described the plan in his 2007 performance self-evaluation:

“Mike [Swenson], Josh [Birnbaum] and I were able to learn from our bad long position at
the end of 2006 and layout the game plan to put on an enormous directional short.  The
results of that are obvious.”1673

In an interview, Mr. Salem told the Subcommittee that the “obvious” results he was referring to
were the desk’s resulting profits.

1674

  

The ABS Desk within the Structured Product Group (SPG) used CDS contracts to short
RMBS and CDO securities as well as the ABX Index.  The Correlation Desk within SPG used a
different technique, obtaining approval to use a Goldman-designed CDO platform, Abacus, “to
short structured product CDOs in bulk.  The ABACUS transactions are currently one of the unique
formats available to . . . [short] in large size on this type of structured product risk.”1675

From January to late February, the Mortgage Department continued to pile on short

Profiting from the First Net Short.  In February 2007, Goldman’s senior management
decided that the $10 billion net short position had become too risky, and ordered the Mortgage
Department to cover a portion of the short.  Covering some of the short not only reduced the risk,
but also locked in some of the profit associated with the position.

In late February 2007, the Mortgage Department’s net short position, coupled with added

volatility in the subprime mortgage market, caused a sharp increase in the Department’s risk
profile, as measured by Value at Risk or “VAR.”  Goldman had assigned a VAR limit of $35
million to the Mortgage Department.

Goldman senior management closely monitored the Department’s increasing VAR.  On

February 23, 2007, Goldman risk controllers told senior executives that the Mortgage
Department’s increasing VAR was “primarily driven by a combination of increased volatility in
ABX market and the [SPG] desk increasing their net short risk in RMBS subprime sector.”
February 14, 2007, Justin Gmelich, a managing director asked to help Mr. Sparks with the
Mortgage Department on a short term basis, sent an email to Mr. Montag expressing unease with
the Department’s increasing risk profile:

1685

“We need to buy back $1 billion single names and $2 billion of the stuff below [CDO

through the market, whatever to get it done.  

It is a great time to do it – bad news on HPA [housing price appreciation], originators

reported to senior management that the ABS Desk had covered $400 million in single name CDS

 the Mortgage Department took

“Market sold off significantly (BBB and BBB- indices over 100 bps wider) We covered
over $400mm single names – still significant work to do. ...

Mr. Ruzika sent an email to Mr. Montag and Mr. Sparks commenting on the covering efforts:

“I think Dan’s guys are being practical.  I know Bill [McMahon] was upset but covering the

The Mortgage Department found that its single name CDS contracts were difficult to cover,

 
in part because many of the referenced RMBS and CDO securities had already been acquired by
securitizers for inclusion in CDOs and so were not for sale.
could not cover its single name short positions simply by buying the offsetting long asset – the
RMBS and CDO securities were no longer available for purchase.
  Instead, the SPG Desk had
to use offsetting CDS contracts, ones which referenced the same RMBS or CDO securities, but in
which Goldman took the long side.
  The problem with those contracts, however, was that many
market participants had already acquired short positions on RMBS and CDO securities and weren’t
in the market to buy more.  In addition, their purchases had driven up the price of short contracts. 
Between market saturation and high price levels, Goldman found few buyers when it wanted to
cover its shorts.

Department’s progress after a week of effort:

single name subprime BBB CDS.  The desk also net sold over $400mm BBB- ABX index.

single names.  Plan is to continue to trade from short side, cover more single names and sell
BBB- index outright.”1694

On February 27, 2007, Mr. Ruzika sent an email to Messrs. Montag, Gmelich, and Sparks
indicating that the Mortgage Department needed to reduce its net short position by covering even
more than $3 billion in shorts:  “There are two issues – first is the size of the short – I want to see

as well.”
  Less than an hour later, Mr. Ruzika sent Mr. Sparks another email at the conclusion of
a meeting of Goldman’s Operating Committee (OpCom), comprised of Goldman’s senior
executives.  In an email entitled, “OpCom Directive,” Mr. Ruzika wrote:

“Dan.  Directly from the opcom we have to pick up the pace of buying back single names
even if it costs us some money.  I know your guys are trying but we can pay away some if it
helps to get size done.”1696

In response,  Mr. Sparks immediately sent an email to Messrs. Swenson, Lehman, and
Birnbaum regarding the “Opcom directive.”  He wrote:  “Buyback single names in size today.”
He also sent the SPG and CDO Desk managers a set of “Goals”:

“Reduce risk.  That means:

reduce the index/index trades in A and AAA.”1698

Mr. Sparks’ list of goals showed that he was closely tracking the SPG Desk’s activities and
directed them to reduce rather than eliminate its basis and index trades.

On February 28, 2007, Mr. Sparks reported at a Firmwide Risk Committee meeting on the

Mortgage Department’s progress in reducing its VAR.
Sparks’ report stated the following:

“–VaR up due to vols.  Business working to reduce exposures; a lot of shorts already
covered.
–ABX widened 500bp on the week.  Business covered $4BN in single names.
–Noted a lot of negative news in the subprime market with rumors on everyone.
–CDS on CDOs started to widen significantly over the week.  ...
–Business continuing to clear out loans.”1701

Five days later, on March 5, 2007, Mr. Montag requested another update:  “Do we think the

business is net short, long or flat right now?”  Mr. Sparks responded: “We think the overall
business is net short.”  Mr. Gmelich added:  “I think we have a very modest short across all the
businesses at current market levels.  I concur with Dan.”1702

The Mortgage Department’s efforts to cover its $10 billion net short position reduced its

VAR; it also allowed the Department to lock in and record large profits from its net shorts.  In
March 2007, in connection with Goldman’s quarterly earnings call with analysts, “Mortgage
Talking Points” prepared for Mr. Viniar stated that the Department’s revenues were primarily the
result of its short positions:

“The Mortgage business’ revenues were primarily driven by synthetic short positions
concentrated in BBB/BBB- sub prime exposure and single A CDO exposure which
benefitted from spread widening.”1703

At the end of the first quarter of 2007, the Mortgage Department reported total net revenues of
$368 million.1704

The Mortgage Department continued its efforts to cover the rest of its short position.  On

AAA Disaster Insurance.  Despite all the attention paid to the Mortgage Department’s

subprime mortgage holdings beginning in December 2006, one large short position seemed to have
escaped the directives of senior management in the first quarter of 2007 to cover the Department’s
shorts.  It consisted of a massive $9 billion net short position made up of CDS contracts
referencing an ABX index that tracked a basket of 20 AAA rated subprime RMBS securities.

The most comprehensive description of the AAA ABX short position located by the
Subcommittee was a chart prepared by a Mortgage Department analyst in August 2007.  The
analyst sent the chart to Mr. Birnbaum at his request, to show the Mortgage Department’s overall
position in synthetic products, including CDS contracts referencing ABX, RMBS, and CDO
assets.
  The chart includes the AAA ABX short position as a long, nearly flat line showing an
approximately $9 billion net short until early July 2007, when the value turned sharply upward.
The analyst wrote in an August email, after much of the AAA ABX net short position had been
covered:  “M[ortgage] department is short ABX AAA [$]8.7b[illion], splitting among ABS/Alt
A/prime/conduit in the beginning of fiscal year 2007, and is now long [$]410m[illion].”  While this
chart and the covering email do not reveal the origin of the AAA short, they indicate that, by early
2007, it was split between the ABS Trading Desk in the Structured Product Group and three desks
in Mr. Gasvoda’s Residential Whole Loan Trading area – the Alt A Trading Desk under Genevieve
Nestor, the Prime Trading Desk under Clay DeJacinto, and the Conduit for conducting subprime
loan pool securitizations under Matt Nichols. 

1715

 

Goldman emails provide additional information about the AAA ABX short.  One series of
emails, from March 2007, indicates that about $8 billion of the $9 billion AAA short was then held
by the three desks in Mr. Gasvoda’s Residential Whole Loan Trading area, and that he favored
maintaining the short, because it provided billions of dollars in coverage and cost only $5 million
per quarter in premiums to maintain.  On March 4, 2007, Mr. Gasvoda emailed Mr. Sparks with
“Quick Thoughts on ABX AAA risk”:

“I talked to [Matt] Nichols and Clay [DeJacinto] about the AAA ABX short.  Think it
offers a good amount downside protection w/ relatively light pain if we’re wrong.  Below is
a $8B ABX AAA short #s.  It costs us $5mm/quarter to carry.  On the downside, if the
market rallies to par ... we drop $50mm.  Taking it to 0 spread we lose $80mm.

“On the upside front, we get good jump risk.  If AAA’s widen to current AA levels ... we
gain $70mm and if spreads move up to super senior risk pricing in CDOs ... we’re up
$190mm.

Hearing Exhibit 4/27-56a.  The analyst’s cover email stated:  “The attached spreadsheet covers the single name and
ABX positions of the entire mortgage department for the fiscal year 2007.  I spot checked the numbers with risk
reports they tie out well.”  See also 8/17/2007 email from Joshua Birnbaum, GS MBS-012928388, Hearing Exhibit
4/27-56b.   
1715
  When shown the chart during his interview, Mr. Sparks told the Subcommittee he was unfamiliar with it and
pointed what he believed to be an anomaly related to its depiction of the Mortgage Department’s short position
involving BBB rated RMBS securities.  He also indicated that he could not confirm its depiction of the AAA ABX
short position.  Since multiple Goldman email messages confirm the existence of the AAA ABX short position
during most of Goldman’s fiscal year 2007, however, the chart’s depiction of that position as a nearly flat line at
about $9 billion short until July 2007 appears consistent with the other evidence.

422

“Net, think this is a good position to have on given downside protection and relatively light
upside pain.  If we get an opportunity to buy some back next week, think we should but I’m
thinking buy back $1-2B, not $8B.”1716

Mr. Sparks replied to Mr. Gasvoda: “Good trading response and thought process.  We need to
consider daily.”1717

The next day, March 5, 2007, the Residential Whole Loan Trading Desk under Mr.

1718

Gasvoda and the CDO Origination Desk under Peter Ostrem exchanged information about the
“ABX hedges” that each business was carrying to reduce the risk associated with its respective
long assets.
  The Residential Whole Loan Trading Desk reported:  “[b]elow are all our ABX
hedges across our Resi Credit + Prime books,” which included approximately $7 billion in AAA
ABX holdings.
  The CDO Origination Desk, in turn, reported holding another $2.25 billion in
AAA ABX “hedges.”
Mr. Egol had remarked: “Love that huge AAA abx short.”

  A few days earlier, with respect to the CDO Origination Desk’s holdings,

1721

1720

  

Although the $7 billion figure reported by Mr. Gasvoda’s group on March 5 was $1 billion

1722

less than the $8 billion reported the day before,
Origination Desk was larger than the $1 billion that the August 2007 email later ascribed to the
Structured Product Group, all of the evidence indicates that Goldman had a massive AAA ABX
short position in 2007.  A few days later, on March 8, 2007, in an email to senior management
entitled, “Mortgage Risk,” Mr. Sparks described the AAA ABX short as a hedge against long
positions in the Department’s loan books and CDO warehouse accounts:

 and the $2.25 billion reported by the CDO

“[O]verall the department has significant shorts against loan books and the CDO
warehouse.  The bulk of these shorts ($9BB) are on the AAA index, so the downside is
limited as the index trades at 99.”

securities offered for sale, it was widely believed in 2006 and 2007, that they would remain
untouched even if defaulting mortgages harmed riskier RMBS securities.  By shorting AAA rated
RMBS securities, Goldman was insuring against a “tail risk” – the risk of an event that appeared to
have a very small probability of ever actually occurring, but which was likely to cause catastrophic
losses if it did occur.  Mr. Sparks also explained that, since the subprime mortgage industry
considered losses in AAA rated RMBS securities to be exceedingly unlikely, the price of acquiring
and holding such a short position was relatively inexpensive.

From the time the $9 billion AAA ABX short was acquired in 2006 until July 2007, it was
not included in Goldman senior management’s directives to cover shorts, and it does not appear to

position in early 2007, or cover that net short in February and March.

began contributing to high VAR levels for the Mortgage Department.  It then drew the attention of
Goldman senior management which included the AAA ABX short in its directive to cover the

Report To Board.  On March 26, 2007, Mr. Sparks and Goldman senior executives gave a
1732

presentation to Goldman’s Board of Directors regarding the firm’s subprime mortgage business.
The presentation recapped for the Board the various steps the Mortgage Department had taken
since December 2006, in response to the deterioration of the subprime mortgage market.
presentation noted, among other measures, the following steps:

1733

  The

 

“– GS reduces CDO activity
– Residual assets marked down to reflect market deterioration
– GS reverses long market position through purchases of single name CDS and reductions
of ABX
– GS effectively halts new purchases of sub-prime loan pools through conservative bids
– Warehouse lending business reduced
– EPD [early payment default] claims continue to increase as market environment
continues to soften.”1734

By the time this presentation was given to the Board of Directors, Goldman’s Mortgage
Department had swung from a $6 billion net long position in December 2006, to a $10 billion net
short position in February 2007, and then acted to cover much of that net short.  Despite having to
sell billions of dollars in RMBS and CDO securities and whole loans at low prices, and enter into
billions of dollars of offsetting long CDS contracts, Goldman’s mortgage business managed to
book net revenues for the first quarter totaling $368 million.1735

In a section entitled, “Lessons Learned,” the presentation stated:  “Capital markets and

financial innovation spread and increase risk,”
 an acknowledgment by Goldman that “financial
innovation,” which in this context included ABX, CDO, and CDS instruments, had magnified the
risk in the U.S. mortgage market.

Goldman had an overall net short position of $2.8 billion.  3/16/2007 draft presentation to Board of Directors by

(c)  Attempted Short Squeeze

425

In May 2007, Goldman’s Structured Product Group (SPG) continued to work to cover the

Mortgage Department’s short position by offering to take the long side of CDS contracts
referencing RMBS and CDO securities, but found few buyers.  Many market participants had
already shorted subprime mortgage assets, driving the price relatively high, and few wanted to buy
additional short positions at the prevailing price.  In order to turn the situation to its benefit, SPG’s
traders attempted to carry out a “short squeeze” of the subprime CDS market in May 2007.

1737

  

1738

The ABS Desk’s traders were already offering single name CDS contracts in which
Goldman would take the long position, in order to cover the Mortgage Department’s short
position.
  To effectuate a short squeeze, they appear to have decided to offer the short positions
on those contracts at lower and lower prices, in order to drive down the  market price of subprime
CDS shorts to artificially low levels.  Once prices fell below what the existing CDS holders had
paid for their short positions, the CDS holders would have to record a loss on their holdings and
might have to post additional cash collateral with their opposing long parties.  Goldman hoped the
CDS holders would react by selling their short positions at the lower market price.  When the sell
off was large enough and the price low enough, Goldman planned to move in and buy more shorts
for itself at the artificially low price. 
   

This short-squeeze strategy was later laid out in a 2007 performance self-evaluation by one
of the traders on Goldman’s ABS Desk who participated in the activity, Deeb Salem.  In the self-
evaluation he provided to senior management, Mr. Salem wrote: 

“In May, while we were remain[ing] as negative as ever on the fundamentals in sub-prime,
the market was trading VERY SHORT, and susceptible to a squeeze. We began to
encourage this squeeze, with plans of getting very short again, after the short squeezed [sic]
cause[d] capitulation of these shorts.  This strategy seemed do-able and brilliant, but once
the negative fundamental news kept coming in at a tremendous rate, we stopped waiting for
the shorts to capitulate, and instead just reinitiated shorts ourselves immediately.”1739

When interviewed by the Subcommittee, Mr. Salem denied that the ABS Desk ever intended to
squeeze the market, and claimed that he had wrongly worded his self-evaluation.
  He said that
reading his self-evaluation as a description of an intended short squeeze put too much emphasis on
“words.”

426

Mr. Salem’s description of an attempted short squeeze by Goldman’s Structured Product

Group is supported by other evidence.  In May 2007, Michael Swenson, the head of both SPG and
ABS Desks and Mr. Salem’s supervisor, wrote emails that appear to confirm the attempted short
squeeze.  In the first email, dated May 25, 2007, Mr. Swenson wrote:

“We should be offering sn [single name] protection down on the offer side to the street on
tier one stuff to cause maximum pain.”1742

Four days later, on May 29, 2007, Mr. Swenson followed up with another email:

“We should start killing the sn [single name] shorts in the street – let’s pick some high
quality stuff that guys are hoping is wider today and offer protection tight – this will have
people totally demoralized.”1743

When asked about these emails, Mr. Swenson also denied that Goldman had attempted to squeeze
the CDS short market.  He claimed that the cost of single name CDS shorts had gone too high, and
the purpose behind Goldman’s actions was to restore balance to the market.
  Mr. Swenson could
not explain, however, why in an effort to restore balance to the market, he used the phrases “cause
maximum pain,” and “this will have people totally demoralized.”
 

Goldman documents show there was a plan and an attempt to conduct a short squeeze,
despite the harm that might be caused to Goldman’s clients.  Contemporaneous emails further
show that clients were complaining about a sudden markdown by Goldman in the value of their
short positions, especially compared to prevailing market prices and the worsening of the subprime
market itself.1745

1744

On May 18, 2007, a Friday, the ABS Desk marked down the value of many of its clients’
CDS short positions.  On Monday, May 21, Mr. Salem sent an email to Mr. Swenson and Edwin
Chin entitled, “A few things . . . pain-related.”1746

“Guys r gonna complain about their marks [hedge fund] already emailed me.  I would talk

reason we moved marks on Friday. ...  [Another customer] lost 6 pct based on fridays
moves.”1747

That same day, a Goldman sales representative sent Mr. Chin a complaint from a hedge

fund customer named Stanfield Capital regarding the lower values assigned to its CDS short
positions.  The sales representative wrote:

“Stanfield feels we are marking them tighter than other dealers with whom they have
similar protection. ... 

In addition, 14 of the 25 names below were marked over 100 bps [basis points] tighter
week-on-week.  That is a massive move and is creating major stress at the clients, as we
can’t see a similar move in the broader market. ... 

Finally, be aware that Stanfield may look for you to offer protection very close to your
mark. ...  I’m hoping your attention to the marks below will defuse a situation in which they
think we’re messing with them via our marks on their protection.”1748

Mr. Chin forwarded the email to Mr. Swenson and Mr. Salem.  Mr. Swenson replied: “We are ok
with that they do not have much more gun powder.”
  Mr. Swenson’s response suggested that
Goldman did not have to be concerned about Stanfield’s threat to buy CDS shorts at the same low
price Goldman had applied to his CDS holdings, since Stanfield did not have the financial
resources – the “gun powder” – to make a large purchase. 

1749

On May 24, 2007, the Stanfield trader wrote to Goldman that he had thought the purchase
of the CDS contract signaled the beginning of a partnership between Stanfield and Goldman, but
he had lost credibility with his company because of the CDS contracts and expressed concern that
he may have been “naive to trust the pitch” from Goldman:

“When we put on the Single A protection trade the underlying names were suppose[d] to
have a large similarity to the index. ...  The indexes are up only a couple of points since we
did the trade.  Looking at the mid’s on our Single A trades we have tightened roughly 33%. 
...  I’m just trying to figure out how we can reverse some of the losses we have incurred.

Also, from where our BBB trade was marked last Friday ... [t]his trade is tighter by 35% as
well.  ...

I had always thought that these trades were meant to be the start of a partnership building of
future business between Stanfield and Goldman Sachs.  I know we are big boys and we did
the trade there is no doubt of that.  What I am attempting to do is either cut our losses and

lot.”1750

A week later, on May 31, 2007, Stark Investments indicated interest in buying a short on

certain RMBS securities backed by home equity loans.  The Goldman sales representative trying to
close the sale emailed SPG personnel that the client was hesitating due to Goldman’s valuations
which were “drastically different” from other dealers:

“Stark has an interest in looking at this trade; but there is an obstacle we need to address:
They feel Goldman is very inconsistent in the single name HEL [Home Equity Loan] CDS
marks that we provide them.  We are drastically different in marking positions versus other
dealers.  It is an annoyance that would potentially limit their interest in putting on
incremental CDS trades.  I can name specific examples if you would like.  Please
advise.”1751

Mr. Salem replied: “you couldn’t be more wrong,” while  Mr. Swenson replied:  

“Frankly, we believe we are best in class and have numerous data from controllers,
collateral posting and markit (the company, not market) that reflect upon this.  This process
is thoroughly reviewed by all levels of senior management at GS. ...

“Unlike other dealers we stand by our marks and are willing to transact in the context of
our marks. ...

We also don’t mark our book wide if we are long protection and tight if we are short. [W]e

When the salesman replied:  “I am trying to work with you guys,” Mr. Swenson chided him:  “You
need to manage their opinions on marks – that has been fully vetted over here.”1753

On June 7, 2007, Mortgage Department personnel learned that two Bear Stearns hedge

2007, Mr. Salem emailed Messrs. Swenson and Chin:

“We need to go to magnetar [a hedge fund] and see if we can buy a bunch of the cdo
protection.  ... Can tell them we have a protection buyer, who is looking to get into this
trade now that spreads have tightened back in.”1755

Raising no concerns about the proposed deception, Mr. Swenson replied “Great idea.”
Salem continued:

  Mr.

“Should we also send an email to select sales people in the mtg [mortgage] sales force

[single name] protection that we want or we gave these guys a chance and nobody can say

Mr. Swenson responded: “We need to be careful.”  Mr. Chin wrote that he knew of another CDO
collateral manager that might also be willing to sell some shorts:  “I mentioned there was a hedge
fund on the side and he was very axed to do something.”1758

Having decided to start buying shorts outright, the ABS Desk also stopped offering to sell
CDS short positions to Goldman customers, effectively abandoning the attempted short squeeze. 
On June 8, 2007, Mr. Swenson told his traders:  “[w]ant to slow down on protection offers.”

  The following week, on June 19, 2007, the Controller’s office sent an email to
Mr. Swenson raising questions about values assigned to certain CDS contracts: “These levels look
quite wide.  Do you have any specific market color that points this direction?”1765

The May 2007 attempted short squeeze described in Mr. Salem’s performance self-

evaluation did not succeed in compelling existing CDS holders to sell their short positions.  In
Subcommittee interviews, Mr. Salem and Mr. Swenson denied that an attempted short squeeze
even took place.  Any attempt that did take place was apparently abandoned in June 2007, when
Goldman stopped offering to sell CDS short positions.  Trading with the intent to manipulate
market prices, even if unsuccessful, is a violation of the federal securities laws.
  Given the
novelty of credit default swaps and their use in the mortgage field, however, the Subcommittee is
unaware of any enforcement action or case applying an anti-manipulate prohibition to the CDS
market.  Because Goldman is a registered broker-dealer subject to the supervision of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the conduct of its ABS traders raises questions about their
compliance with FINRA’s Rule 2010, which provides:  “A member, in the conduct of his or her
business, must observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of
trade.”

(d) Building the Big Short

In the months of June and July 2007, Goldman’s Mortgage Department went short again. 

This time, it built an even larger net short position than earlier in the year, reaching a peak of $13.9
billion in late June,

 which Mr. Viniar later referred to as “the big short.”

position included the $9 billion AAA ABX short which had suddenly begun gaining value as the
subprime market worsened.  In June, two Bear Stearns hedge funds specializing in subprime
mortgage assets collapsed.  In July 2007, the credit rating agencies began downgrading ratings for
hundreds and then thousands of RMBS and CDO securities.  Soon after, the subprime mortgage
backed securities market froze and then collapsed.  Each of these events increased the value of
Goldman’s net short position.

Bear Stearns Hedge Fund Collapse.  The collapse of the Bear Stearns hedge funds in

mid-June triggered Goldman’s effort to rebuild its net short position.  On June 7, 2007, the
Mortgage Department learned that the Bear Stearns hedge funds were seeking quietly to sell some
of their subprime portfolio to meet client redemption requests, which Goldman interpreted as a
signal of serious financial distress.
employee remarked:

  After reviewing the hedge funds’ assets, one Goldman

“In total these two portfolios add up to roughly $17bil in total exposure after leverage.  It
goes without saying that if this portfolio were to be released into the market the
implications would be pretty severe.”1770

1769
  See 6/7/2007 Goldman email chain, “BSAM Post,” GS MBS-E-011184213. 
1770
  Id.  Some have suggested that the financial problems experienced by the Bear Stearns hedge funds were caused
in part by severe markdowns taken by Goldman on assets held in the funds’ portfolios, and that Goldman caused the
funds to collapse.  In its final report, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) briefly addressed these
allegations.  See The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report 2010 at 237-40, 244 (hereinafter “Final Report”).  Goldman
denied the allegations with respect to its April and May 2007 marks in filings with the FCIC.   See 11/1/2010 letter
from Goldman counsel Janet Broecke to FCIC, “FCIC Requests for Documents and Information” and Appendices A-
G, available at www2.goldmansachs.com.  The FCIC’s Final Report was critical of Goldman’s marks in general as
being significantly lower than those of other banks and noted in particular its collateral dispute with AIG.  See Final
Report at 243-44, 265-71.  With respect to the Bear Stearns hedge funds, however, the Final Report merely noted
that Bear Stearns had disputed marks from Goldman and three other banks and cited the testimony of the funds’
portfolio manager, Ralph Cioffi, that “a number of factors contributed to the April revision [in the hedge funds’
values, which ultimately led to the funds’ collapse], and Goldman’s marks were one factor.”  Final Report at 240.  

In addition to the markdowns in April and May, Goldman also marked down certain CDO securities held by
the Bear Stearns funds in June 2007, but it appears those June markdowns did not play a significant role in the hedge
funds’ collapse. That month, Goldman marked down their positions in four Goldman CDOs by two points each.  See,
e.g., 6/8/2007 email from Jonathan Egol to Daniel Sparks, “BSAM mark recap,” GS MBS-E-001920339 (Mr. Egol
emailed Mr. Sparks a recap of the Bear Stearns markdowns and stated:  “We lowered the marks on 4 bonds down 2
pts each.”).

Mr. Swenson had urged larger markdowns, but his advice was not followed.  On June 7, 2007, Mr. Egol had

first marked down the funds’ holdings in a single Abacus CDO by 2 points, from 89 to 87.  Mr. Egol emailed Mr.
Sparks a spreadsheet with a cover note: “GS exposure to BSAM [Bear Stearns Asset Management] as of today. 
ABACUS mark corrected to 87 to handle.”  6/7/2007 email from Mr. Egol to Mr. Sparks GS MBS-E-003375593. 
Since Abacus was only one of four Goldman CDOs in which the Bear Stearns funds held positions, Mr. Swenson
emailed Mr. Lehman recommending further markdowns:

The failure of the Bear Stearns hedge funds triggered another decline in the value of

subprime mortgage related assets.  The ABX Index, which was already falling, began a steep, sharp
decline.  The collapse had further negative effects when the hedge funds’ massive subprime
holdings were suddenly dumped on the market for sale, further depressing prices of subprime
RMBS and CDO assets. 

 The creditors of the Bear Stearns hedge funds met with Bear Stearns management in an

underway, Goldman and Bear Stearns agreed to an unwind in which Goldman bought back $300
million of two AAA CDO tranches of Goldman’s Timberwolf CDO, which the hedge funds had
purchased two months earlier in April 2007.  Goldman paid Bear Stearns 96 and 90 cents on the

  While those efforts were

1777

Goldman’s Structured Product Group (SPG) took the collapse of the Bear Stearns hedge
funds as the signal to begin rebuilding its net short position.  As Joshua Birnbaum, the head ABX
trader on the SPG Desk, later wrote:

this mark-to-market event for CDO risk would begin a further unraveling in mortgage

Daniel Sparks to David Viniar, “CDO^2s,” GS MBS-E-009747489.  The prices Goldman paid to Bear Stearns on
the A1B and A1C tranches of Timberwolf were approximately one cent (or 100 basis points) above its own internal
marks on the Timberwolf tranches in the week of June 18, which were then at 95 and 89 points, respectively.  Id.  In
May 2007, Goldman had completed a re-evaluation of its CDO assets, which suggested on a preliminary basis that
the AAA Timberwolf securities should be marked down dramatically in value.   Accordingly, Goldman may have
been generous toward Bear Stearns in buying back the Timberwolf positions at 96 and 90.  On the other hand,
repurchasing the Timberwolf securities near its own low internal marks might have reduced the price Goldman could
obtain in reselling the tranches, which it identified in a June 22 sales directive to its sales force and recommended
selling at 98.5 and 95, respectively.   When asked about the buyback of the Timberwolf tranches, Mr. Viniar told the
Subcommittee that Goldman had financed the purchase of both tranches and may have been legally entitled to seize
them, but there are circumstances in which Goldman voluntarily settles a dispute on agreed terms, rather than going
through the legal process entailed in seizing and selling collateral.  Subcommittee interview of David Viniar.

In a later internal presentation for Goldman senior executives which Mr. Birnbaum drafted

for another purpose,
Trading Desks went net short outright and that the shorts were not a hedge for long positions:

 Mr. Birnbaum wrote that, after the Bear Stearns funds collapsed, SPG’s

“By June, all retained CDO and RMBS positions were identified already hedged. ...  SPG
trading reinitiated shorts post BSAM [Bear Stearns Asset Management] unwind on an
outright basis with no accompanying CDO or RMBS retained position longs.  In other
words, the shorts were not a hedge.”1782

On June 29, 2007, the ABX Index and the value of single name CDS contracts referencing

RMBS and CDO securities plummeted in value and continued dropping until mid-July.  Mr.
Swenson, head of the SPG Trading Desk, exchanged emails with Mr. Lehman and other Goldman
executives about that day’s trading: “There is absolutely no support at the lower levels from the
street.  CDOs are wider by 50 bps or more.”  Mr. Lehman responded:  “[W]e r in the middle of a

On July 10, 2007, the two primary ratings agencies, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, began

the first of many mass ratings downgrades for subprime RMBS and CDO securities.
downgrades sent another negative shockwave through the subprime mortgage market as investors

On July 27, 2007, a Goldman senior sales executive summarized the state of the market:

“Whether you remember ‘94, ‘98, or ‘03, the general themes/patterns are consistent.  An
initial dislocation to the market (in this instance a credit deterioration in sub prime
mortgages) acts as a tipping point and leads to spread widening in other sectors.  This in
turn quickly becomes a liquidity crunch/crisis.  It appears this is where the structured
product market is now – searching for liquidity.  This has produced numerous
capitulation/liquidation situations and forced customers to trade. . . . The impact of this
week leaves the account base in three camps:  The Paralyzed . . . The Wounded (some
fatally) . . . The Opportunistic.”1787

Although the July subprime market meltdown was a disaster for many investors, the value
of Goldman’s net short positions climbed rapidly.  Senior management at all levels were aware of
the Mortgage Department’s net short and the profits it was generating.  On July 20, 2007, CEO
Lloyd Blankfein and COO Gary Cohn received a profit and loss report showing that the Mortgage
Department was up $72.7 million for the day, across almost every mortgage trading desk.  Mr.
Cohn wrote to Mr. Blankfein: “There is a net short.”
Department posted a profit of $83 million for the day, while the firm’s overall net revenue for the
day was only $74 million.
“Mergers, overnight asia and especially short mortgages saved the day.”   On July 29, 2007, Mr.
Sparks reported to Messrs. Montag and Mullen:

  Mr. Viniar forwarded the report to Mr. Blankfein with a note saying:

for the $100mm [error] discussed today).  Correlation P&L on the week was $234mm, with
CMBS, CDOs, and RMBS/ABX shorts all contributing.”1790

Mr. Birnbaum later recapped the SPG Trading Desk’s profits during this period:  “[W]hen the

month.”

Covering the Big Short to Lock in Profits.  Starting in July and throughout August 2007,

Goldman undertook an intensive effort to cover its $13.9 billion net short and lock in its profits. 
To do so, the Mortgage Department bought long assets, offered CDS contracts in which it took the
long side, and even sold some short positions.  

The Mortgage Department was particularly focused on purchasing long AAA assets to

cover Goldman’s $9 billion AAA ABX short, to lock in the unexpected profits on that position.  In
August 2007, Mr. Lehman, co-head of the SPG Desk, wrote: “[A]s swenny/deeb/josh have done an
awesome job sourcing risk, the CDO transition book AAA ABX short decreased from 1.55bb to
250m over the past two weeks – we love covering that trade.”
Montag reported to Messrs. Cohn and Viniar:   “We ... bought back almost 9 billion of aaa abx
over last two weeks.”1793

  On August 23, 2007, Mr.

1792

From mid-July through the end of August, the Mortgage Department also covered a range

of other shorts.

1794

  On August 5, 2007, Mr. Swenson reported a “phenomenal week”:

“In summary, a phenomenal week for covering our Index shorts on the week.  The ABS
Desk bought $3.3bb of ABX Index across various vintages and ratings over the past week. 
$1.5 billion was retained by the ABS desk to cover shorts in ABX ($900mm in ABX 06-1
As being the most significant) and $1.0 billion was sold to internal desks across the
mortgage department ($925mm in triple-As).”1795

Mr. Swenson also reported that the Mortgage Department was still $8.3 billion net short across all
subprime asset classes, including $4 billion of AAA ABX assets.

1796

 

On August 8, the market rallied for a short period, and the Mortgage Department’s net short

position suffered a $100 million loss.  Mr. Swenson explained:  “Market rallied especially at the
top end of the capital structure – AAA (up 2 pts), AA (up 3 pts), and A (up 2 pt.).”  He reported
that the Department still held a $3.1 billion net short in AAA rated subprime mortgage assets.
1797
Mr. Montag replied:  “now on to the 3 billion short.”
Montag reported to his colleagues:  “mortgages bought back 1 billion of 3 billion short in AAA
indices at ½ to 1 point better than yesterday.”1799

  The next day, August 9, 2007, Mr.

On August 20, 2007, Mr. Sparks reported on the Mortgage Department’s progress in

covering its net short, telling Mr. Montag:  “[L]oan books had been heavily net short (still are some

responded:  “[H]eavily isn’t the half of it – we have bought back 4 - 5 billion and still short.”1802

Buying More AAA RMBS Securities.  In August 2007, the Mortgage Department

proposed buying $10 billion in AAA rated RMBS securities, but did not receive permission to
initiate the investment.  

By August 2007, AAA rated RMBS and CDO securities were available from many

1803

financial firms at a very low price.  On August 14, 2007, in summarizing the prior week’s trading
Mr. Swenson wrote:  “Top of the capital structure is where all the action is.  AAAs are extremely

great opportunity and we continue to like it.”
  On August 19, 2007, Mr. Lehman reported that
the Mortgage Department had purchased $1.6 billion of the long side of CDS contracts referencing
the ABX Index for AAA RMBS securities, and that its value had increased 1.5 percent over the
prior week.  Given Goldman’s dominant market share and recent large purchases, however, Mr.
Montag was skeptical: “How much of the aaa outperforming was us buying?”
  Mr. Birnbaum
responded:  “On the AAA outperformance question, I think AAAs would have performed similarly
without our adding.”
  He also wrote that the “likelihood of loss on ‘real’ RMBS AAAs (i.e., not
AAA CDOs),” was “remote.”

According to Mr. Birnbaum, a key reason for buying the AAA rated assets was that Mr.

On August 14, 2007, Mr. Sparks updated Goldman senior executives on the success of the
Mortgage Department’s efforts to cover its shorts and added that the Department was interested in
increasing its purchase of AAA rated RMBS securities:  “we will likely come to you soon and say
we’d like to get long billions[.]”
responded:   “We’re continuing to cover some shorts and we may cover some BBB with AAA, but
I got the message clearly that we shouldn’t get long without Gary [Cohn]/Tom [Montag]/Don

On August 20, 2007, Mr. Sparks pitched the idea again to Mr. Montag and other senior

“We are seeing large liquidations – we bought $350mm AAA subprime RMBS from ... SIV
unwinds today. ...  We think it is now time to start using balance sheet and it is a unique
opportunity with real upside – specifically for AAA RMBS.  We’ve sold over $100mm of
what we bought today – most up 1-2 points.  

That’s a great trade – buy and flip up 1-2 points, however, we’re not always going to be
able to do that – and there’s the opportunity for us to make 5-10 points if we have a longer
term hold.”1814

“– The mortgage department thinks there is currently an extraordinary opportunity for those
with dry powder to add AAA subprime risk in either cash or synthetic form.

– We would like to be opportunistic buyers of up to $10Bln subprime AAAs in either cash
or synthetic (ABX) form and run that long against our $3.5Bln in mezzanine subprime
shorts.

– Mortgage dept VAR would be reduced by $75mm and Firmwide VAR would be reduced
by $25mm.

– At current dollar prices, the implied losses at the AAA level are 2.5x higher than the
implied losses at the BBB level where we have our shorts (the ratio is even cheaper for cash
due to technicals).  If AAAs were priced consistent with BBB implied loss levels, they
would be trading 5-10pts higher in synthetics and 10-15 points higher in cash. ...

(e)  “Get Down Now”

440

Despite direction from senior management to cover its $13.9 billion net short position, the
Mortgage Department continued to maintain several large net shorts, including at least $3 billion in
single name CDS contracts referencing BBB and BBB- rated RMBS securities that it expected to
gain in profits.  In August 2007, Co-President Gary Cohn finally issued an order to “get down
now.”1820

Excessive VAR.  By late August, a combination of the large net short and volatility in the

subprime mortgage market had driven the Mortgage Department’s VAR to an all-time high.  When
the AAA ABX short position was far out-of-the-money, it entailed little market risk, as it was not
actively traded and had little likelihood of ever paying off.  Once the AAA ABX short became
profitable, however, the $9 billion position was so large that it had a major impact on the firm’s
risk measurements.  Even a small percentage change in $9 billion can cause substantial changes in
a profit and loss statement.  As Mr. Sparks explained:  “The combination of our large AAA ABX
index shorts and the relatively new volatility in the AAA part of the index will result in much
larger daily swings in P&L [profit and loss] both ways.”

As predicted, due to the $9 billion short, the Mortgage Department’s daily profit and loss

reports began to show much larger swings.

1827

 the gyrations in daily profit and loss figures demonstrated that the $9 billion net

VAR depends primarily on the aggregate size of net asset positions and the volatility of the
relevant market.  Goldman was holding several large net short positions, the subprime market had
become extremely volatile, and the Department’s efforts to cover its shorts further complicated
matters.  Although Goldman’s covering of its $9 billion net short AAA position would ordinarily
be expected to reduce risk, the massive size of the position, combined with unprecedented levels of
volatility in the market, the speed of Goldman’s covering, and the size of the trades involved,
resulted in steep increases in the Department’s VAR.  

The Mortgage Department’s VAR had increased from around $13 million in mid-2006,

well under the Department’s permanent limit of $35 million, to $85 million in February 2007, to a
high of around $113 million in August 2007.
Department’s $35 million permanent VAR limit by more than 350%.  Moreover, the Mortgage
Department, which had never contributed more than about 2% of firmwide net revenue prior to
2007, was generating some 54% of all the risk incurred by the firm in August 2007.  The Mortgage
Department’s risk level, however profitable, was of increasing concern from a firmwide
perspective.1829

(f)  Profiting from the Big Short:  Making “Serious Money”

444

Goldman’s short positions continued to produce profits for the firm, as mortgage related

assets continued to lose value.  In September 2007, one of the key traders in the Mortgage
Department, Deeb Salem, summarized four key short-side trading strategies that enabled the
Mortgage Department to profit from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market:

1845

  

 

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

a “dispersion trade,” in which Goldman took advantage of “mispriced” single name
CDS contracts that referenced very poorly performing RMBS securities, but were not
priced much lower than better performing RMBS securities, resulting in profits of
$750 million “so far”;

a massive purchase of single name CDS contracts referencing a variety of RMBS
securities, taking advantage of Goldman’s estimated 33% “dominant” market share in
single name CDS to make a “HUGE directional bet” against the subprime mortgage
market, resulting in profits of $1.7 billion;1846

the purchase “at a discount” of single name CDS contracts referencing Alt A and A
rated RMBS securities, which “others don’t want/know where to price,” resulting in
profits of $400 million “so far”; and

the purchase of single name CDS contracts on A, AA and AAA rated CDO securities
“in size,” amassing an “enormous” market share whose profits had “exceeded all of
our high expectations” at $900 million “so far.”1847

  Salem 2007 Self-Review.
  Id. [emphasis in original].
  Id.  Mr. Salem described the trading strategies as follows:

“a.  The Dispersion Trade 
More than a year ago, Edwin [Chin] and I realized that the dispersion amongst single-name subprime CDS was
grossly mispriced.  Bad names (tier 4), that the market almost universally disliked traded only 50 bps wider than
securities that we all agreed were superior. ...  So for the past year, we bought protection on tier 4 names at every
chance possible . . . When we wanted to flatten out the book, we just  wrote protection on the tier 1 names. 
Amazingly we did this for most of the year without a usable model to value different single names. ... We were very
aggressive with pricing and only shared risk with smart guys if they gave us insight on names to go short or go long
in return.  Even when the dispersion widened out ... by the end of February, Edwin and I refused to monetize the
trade .... With 3-4bb of notional in this dispersion trade, we have recognized $750mm of P&L so far on this trade.

“b.  Our single name market share:
Having traded over $200bb of notional in SN [single name] CDS, GS is the dominant market-maker in single name
CDS.  We approximate our market share to be greater than 33%. ...  This market share and willingness to trade size
proved invaluable in November, December and January when we decided to make the HUGE directional bet of
being long SN CDS protection [or “short risk,” i.e., taking the short side of a CDS transaction]. ...  If we did not have
such presence in the SN CDS market, it is unlikely that we would have achieved the size short that we desired and
eventually put on.  We’re up $1.7bb in RMBS SN CDS!

445

In October 2007, after the credit rating agencies downgraded hundreds of CDO

1848

securities,
 Mr. Swenson wrote to Mr. Mullen that the downgrades would eventually cause
defaults in many CDO securities that Goldman had shorted, meaning that Goldman’s “CDS
protection premiums paid out will go to zero,”
payments on those CDOs from the long parties.  Mr. Mullen responded:  “Looks like we’re going
to make some serious money.”  Mr. Swenson replied:  “Yes, we are well-positioned.”

“c.  Willingness to put on trades that others don’t want/know where to price
The 2 most successful trades in this regard have been our $70mm long Alt-A protection and our $1-2bb long sub-
prime Single-A protection [i.e., being “short risk” or taking short side in a CDS transaction].  When CDOs wanted to
sell Alt-A and single-A protection ... the rest of the street was tentative. ...  We viewed this as a tremendous
opportunity to buy cheap out-of-the-money options at a significant discount to fair-value.  Our exit strategy was
always that if sub-prime fundamentals got bad enough, and they did, that the contagion would have to spread up the
capital structure because cum loss vol/uncertainty has to go up thus. . . .$400mm so far for the desk ....

reasons:  ... [T]he rating agencies’ correlation assumptions were out of whack with the growing concern about the
housing market and the remarkable similarity between the bonds in a CDO, the difficulty that GS was having in
placing such mezzanine liabilities and the complexity of such securities scared hedge funds from buying the
protection themselves.   Edwin and I used the same aggressive strategies in purchasing protection that we used to
dominate the SN CDS market.  Our market share was enormous ... and we did every ...  trade possible.”  Id.

(i)  Top Sheets

Daniel Sparks told the Subcommittee that, in 2006 and earlier, he was frustrated because he

felt Goldman had inadequate systems to track and aggregate the daily positions of the various
desks in the Mortgage Department.
  At the end of each trading day, he had to review up to a
dozen separate reports from the desks to develop a composite mental picture of the Mortgage
Department’s overall positions.  To remedy this shortcoming, in February 2007, Mr. Sparks and
the Department’s strategic analysts, sometimes called “strats,” developed a single-page report
called the Mortgage Department Top Sheet.

1858

1857

  

The Mortgage Department Top Sheet became the primary report through which the

Mortgage Department tracked its daily positions in various classes of mortgage related assets.   It
provided a comprehensive listing of the Mortgage Department’s long and short positions in
different asset classes across all desks at the end of each trading day.  The Top Sheet drew data
from up to a dozen separate reports generated by Goldman’s electronic systems.  Mr. Sparks told
the Subcommittee that the Top Sheet evolved over time to become a good tool that provided a
comprehensive record of the Department’s positions.
Subcommittee that Goldman did not maintain any other type of comprehensive daily report
regarding the Mortgage Department’s net positions in various asset classes.

report available to Mortgage Department managers, some more senior Goldman executives appeared to be unaware
of its existence.  Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick, for example, testified that he was unaware of a Mortgage
Department Top Sheet and he thought the “top sheet” concept might not be suitable for the Mortgage Department.

translated the Mortgage Department’s electronic trading data directly into risk measures, such as “VAR.”  Id.; see
also, e.g., 8/9/2007 email from risk manager, “MarketRisk: Mortgage Risk Report (cob 08/08/2007),” GS MBS-E-

The Top Sheet was literally the top sheet, or cover page, to a comprehensive report

distributed daily to Mr. Sparks and other Mortgage Department managers.
Top Sheet listed the aggregate total amounts held by the Mortgage Department in various asset
classes, including AAA, AA, BBB, and BBB- rated assets.
  During most of 2007, the Top Sheet
also provided an overall net short or long figure that summed across the top line totals for each of
the respective asset classes, providing an overall figure by which the Mortgage Department was net
long or net short across all asset classes each day.  By plotting this overall net figure for each daily
Top Sheet, the Subcommittee developed a graph of the Mortgage Department’s net position during
2007, as indicated on the chart on the following page.1863

The Subcommittee’s net short chart is generally consistent with a Goldman chart that Mr.
Birnbaum asked one of the Mortgage Department’s analysts to prepare for him in August 2007,
which can be seen on the following page.

[SEE CHART NEXT PAGE: RMBS Subprime Notional History,
prepared by Goldman Sachs.]1864

The “zero” line in the middle of the chart represents a neutral trading position that is neither
net long nor net short.  To use Mr. Viniar’s description, the zero line represents “home.”  The area
below the zero line represents net short positions; the area above the line represents net long
positions.  The chart shows that the Goldman Mortgage Department was net short throughout
2007, with a total net short position that reached $13.9 billion in July.

  8/17/2007 Goldman internal chart, “RMBS Subprime Notional History (Mtg Dept - ‘Mtg NYC SPG

1864
Portfolio’),” GS MBS-E-012928391, Hearing Exhibit 4/27-56a.  The title of the Goldman chart, “NYC SPG
Trading” is confusing, as Mr. Birnbaum asked the analyst, Kevin Kao, for a chart of all synthetic positions across the
entire Mortgage Department (including areas other than SPG Trading).  In an email to Mr. Birnbaum, Mr. Kao
confirmed that despite the title, the chart actually included all synthetic positions across the entire Mortgage
Department, and not just the SPG Trading Desk positions.  8/17/2007 email from Mr. Kao to Mr.  Birnbaum, GS
MBS-E-012929469.  Mr. Kao explained that his chart did not include cash positions, meaning long positions in
mortgage loans or RMBS from any remaining warehouse inventory.  Id.  That omission was not significant, however,
since Goldman had rapidly sold off the vast bulk of its cash inventory starting in November 2006.  4/2010 “Goldman
Sachs Long Cash Subprime Mortgage Exposure, Investments in Subprime Mortgage Loans, and Investments in
Subprime Mortgage Backed Securities November 24, 2006 vs. August 31, 2007 - in $ Billions,” chart prepared by
the Subcommittee, Hearing Exhibit 4/27-163.  In any event, the Subcommittee’s net short chart includes the
Department’s cash positions and demonstrates that any long cash positions were insufficient to offset the shorts, as
the Mortgage Department was massively net short throughout most of 2007.  See PSI Net Short Chart.  

In his Supplemental Responses to Questions for the Record from the Subcommittee, Mr. Birnbaum

conceded that the Subcommittee’s net short chart includes cash positions and therefore fixed the problem of being
limited to synthetics as was the case with Goldman’s own net short chart.  See 8/17/2007 Goldman internal chart,
“RMBS Subprime Notional History (Mtg Dept - Mtg NYC SPG Portfolio),” GS MBS-E-012928391, Hearing
Exhibit 4/27-56a; Birnbaum responses to Subcommittee QFRs at PSI_QFR_GS0509.  Mr. Birnbaum maintained his
objection that the Subcommittee’s net short chart improperly summed the notional amounts of different asset classes. 
Id.  However, as noted in the text, the Mortgage Department’s Top Sheet actually converted the notional amounts of
each asset class into their market values, making it fair to sum across all asset classes.

Some Goldman representatives told the Subcommittee that they objected to both the

451

  For example, in a 2010 interview with the Subcommittee, Mr. Birnbaum

Subcommittee’s net short chart, and Goldman’s own similar chart, on the grounds that the charts
are too simplistic and fail to account for the relative “weight” or value of short positions in
differing asset classes.
said that because of their differing “weights” or values relative to one another, the notional
amounts in each asset class could not simply be summed up together.  For example, he said the
notional amount of AAA assets cannot be added to the notional amount of BBB assets, because the
market assigns each of those positions different weights or values relative to each other.
said that these relative weights or values are often expressed as specific “hedge ratios” which
Goldman traders can call up on their computer screens in real time to tell them, for example, the
amount of AAA assets they should buy long to hedge a given net short position in BBB assets.
 
1867
Each class also poses a different level of risk than the others.  For example, short positions in AAA
assets were relatively inexpensive, as the risk of loss in that tier was considered relatively low,
while short positions in BBB assets would have higher prices, because the risk of loss was
considered high.  Mr. Birnbaum said the only chart of Goldman’s net short position that he would
accept as fairly representative would be one that was “Beta-adjusted” to account for differences in
the relative weights, but he admitted that he was unaware of any such charts or reports created by
Goldman during 2007.
  Without considering these relative weights (which continually change
based on market price movements in various asset tiers), Mr. Birnbaum said it would be
impossible to say that Goldman was ever “net short” at all or in what amount.1869

  He

1868

Goldman’s own documents provide a different picture, however.  The Top Sheet was the
primary comprehensive record used by the Mortgage Department to track all net positions across
the Mortgage Department.  Goldman did not keep any other records that identified the Mortgage
Department’s net positions in various asset classes,
 and did not keep any records that used the
“Beta-adjustment” method advocated by Mr. Birnbaum.  By early March 2007, the Top Sheet
generally expressed the market values of positions in different asset classes, rather than the

remembered his desk being net short, Mr. Swenson replied: “$9 billion.”  Subcommittee interview of Michael
Swenson (4/16/2010).
1870
  As noted above, the risk management and controller areas at Goldman kept their own daily reports based on the
Mortgage Department’s electronic trading data, but they did not track Goldman’s aggregate positions in each asset
class on either a notional or market value basis.  Rather, the risk area converted the Mortgage Department data into
risk measures, while the controllers’ area converted the data into profit and loss reports.  Though based on the
Mortgage Department’s reported daily trading, these reports did not directly reflect specific net positions in subprime
mortgage assets.

452

1871

notional amount of the positions.
  By using the market values of positions in each asset class on
a given day, the Mortgage Department did, in fact, create a reasonable method for summing across
all asset classes in a single common denominator – the amount of cash the assets would bring in
the market that day.  Since the Subcommittee’s net short chart relies on the Department’s daily Top
Sheet figures as expressed in market values rather than notional amounts, it does not suffer from
the incompatibility defect pointed out by Mr. Birnbaum.

Mr. Birnbaum’s position that the notional amounts of each asset class cannot be summed
up together is also inconsistent with what Goldman’s Mortgage Department did on a day-to-day
basis in 2007.  Mr. Sparks, the Mortgage Department head who helped design the Top Sheet, used
it to measure the Department’s daily position.  Mortgage Department personnel and other Goldman
executives also discussed the Department’s being “net short”– either overall or in specific asset
classes – on a daily basis.

1872

  

Indeed, the phrase “net short” appears more than 3,400 times in the documents produced to

1873

the Subcommittee by Goldman.
  Since Mr. Birnbaum claimed that one could never really say
whether Goldman was truly “net short,” the Subcommittee asked him why the phrase “net short”
appeared so many times in Goldman’s documents.  Mr. Birnbaum said that the use of the phrase
“net short” was a “shorthand” that was used internally in the Mortgage Department.
  In fact,
neither Mr. Birnbaum, Goldman, nor the Subcommittee could identify any specific document or
instance from 2007 in which the weighting exercise advocated by Mr. Birnbaum in his September
2010 interview was ever used or suggested.

1874

Aside from the Top Sheet that summed up totals across different asset classes to obtain an

aggregate total, there are also many documents in which Goldman personnel described the total
amounts by which Goldman was net short in respective asset classes.  For example, Mr. Swenson,
and later Mr. Lehman, compiled an email summary each week that described each Mortgage
Department desk’s net position in different asset classes.  A typical format was as follows:

subtracted from VAR.  In February and August 2007, most of Goldman’s senior management expressed concern that
the large net short positions added to VAR, rather than subtracted from it, and indeed, pushed the firmwide VAR to
record levels.

chief architects of Goldman’s big short, stated:

“By June [2007], all retained CDO and RMBS positions were identified as already hedged.
...  SPG trading re-initiated shorts post BSAM [Bear Stearns Asset Management] unwind

other words, the shorts were not a hedge.”

  (Emphasis in original). 

1883

In response to Questions for the Record from the Subcommittee, Mr. Birnbaum once again stated
that SPG Trading initiated the “shorts on an outright basis with no accompanying CDO or RMBS
retained position longs following the Bear Stearns Asset Management unwind in 2007, and that
these positions were not a hedge.”1884

 
Mr. Birnbaum’s statement that “all retained CDO and RMBS positions were identified as

already hedged” by June 2007 is also supported by other documents provided by Goldman’s
Mortgage Department.  On February 28, 2007, for example, David Rosenblum, Co-Head of the
CDO/CLO Origination Desk, initiated a project to ensure that all of the CDO Origination Desk’s
warehouse accounts were “fully hedged.”
  As a result, the CDO Origination Desk initiated new
hedges and specifically allocated others to cover all the desk’s warehouse risk.  Learning of these
actions, Mr. Rosenblum responded:  “Great. Getting pretty nailed down.”

(ii)  Risk Reports

The Mortgage Department’s large net short positions were also demonstrated by the
periodic risk reports that recorded Goldman’s key risk measure, “Value at Risk” or “VAR,”
throughout 2007.  At a 95% confidence level, VAR represents the dollar amount a business unit,
here the Mortgage Department, could expect to make or lose once every 20 trading days – or about
once a month.

1889

 

The Mortgage Department’s VAR skyrocketed during 2007, climbing far beyond the

Mortgage Department’s permanent VAR limit of $35 million and hitting a record high of $113
million in mid-August 2007.
  In 2007, with notable exceptions discussed below, whenever the
Mortgage Department’s trading exceeded its risk limits, Goldman’s risk managers simply assigned
the department a new, higher “temporary” risk limit to accommodate the Department’s trading.1891

1890

At the same time, the higher VAR did signal the presence of a large net short position and
functioned to limit the size of that position.  Twice during 2007, in late February and again in late
August, Goldman’s senior executives ordered the Mortgage Department to reduce its large short
positions in order to bring the firm’s overall VAR measure down.
  The senior executives were
aware of the Mortgage Department’s large net short positions, in part, because those positions had
contributed to increases in Goldman’s firmwide or trading VAR.

1896
inappropriate risk measure for the Mortgage Department’s shorting activities. 8/9/2007 email from Joshua Birnbaum

numbers are ludicrous, btw.  Completely overestimated for SPG trading, underestimated for other mortgage desks.”). 
He contended that for various reasons, the Mortgage Department was not actually as short as the VAR measure
reflected.  See, e.g., 9/26/2007 2007 MD Reviews, Joshua Birnbaum Self-Review, GS-PSI-01956, Hearing Exhibit
4/27-55c.  In arguing for a special compensation model for the SPG Trading Desk, Mr. Birnbaum pointed out that
the desk never lost as much money as the firm’s VAR measure predicted it would. 10/3/2007 Goldman presentation,
“SPG Trading – 2007,” GS MBS-E-015654036.   Accordingly, Mr. Birnbaum may have been correct that the firm’s
VAR measure did not accurately measure risk to the firm.  Id.  On the other hand, since VAR rests on probability
theory which is based on a “normal” distribution of profits and losses (the typical “bell curve”), the Mortgage
Department may have benefitted from the extraordinary and continual one-way movement downward in the subprime
mortgage markets.  

One risk management expert testified before Congress:  “It is well known that VaR cannot measure crisis
risk.  During periods of crisis the relationship between securities changes in strange and seemingly unpredictable
ways.  VaR, which depends critically on a set structure for volatility and correlation, cannot provide useful
information in this situation.  It contains no mechanism for predicting the type of crisis that might occur, and does
not consider the dynamics of market crises.  This is not to say that VaR has no value or is hopelessly flawed.  Most
of the time it will provide a reasonable measure of risk – indeed the vast majority of the time this will be the case.  If
one were forced to pick a single number for the risk of a portfolio in the near future, VaR would be a good choice for
the job.”  Prepared statement of Richard Bookstaber, “The Risks of Financial Modeling: VaR and the Economic

  The Mortgage Department had other risk limits aside from VAR, including Credit Spread Widening or “CSW,”

“dv01,” which measures the dollar amount by which a security’s value would change based on a 1 basis point change
in the relevant index or interest rate; and balance sheet limits, meaning the amount of Goldman’s balance sheet the

diversified) positions that are trading at steady and predictable price levels.  By contrast, VAR is higher if a desk is
holding a small number of very large and highly correlated positions that are trading at volatile and unpredictable
price levels.  The position size/correlation and volatility factors may also operate independently.  Thus, even if the
desk has a large number of relatively small and non correlated positions, VAR tends to rise as the volatility of
trading rises.  Similarly, even if there is little volatility in trading, VAR tends to rise as the desk’s position sizes
become larger and increasingly correlated.  The two factors also reinforce one another – large position sizes
combined with high volatility tend to increase VAR dramatically.

increase.  Goldman’s Chief Risk Officer, Craig Broderick, told the Subcommittee that he would be
concerned about any breach of a VAR limit, and would certainly investigate the doubling of a
business unit’s VAR, but he admittedly took no action when the Mortgage Department’s VAR
more than quintupled over the course of a single quarter.  Mr. Broderick attributed the steep rise in
VAR almost exclusively to unprecedented market volatility,
 although other Goldman officials
stated that the VAR levels were being driven by Goldman’s large net short positions.1914

1913

For the most part, Goldman’s risk managers ignored the Mortgage Department’s VAR
violations and did not demand immediate compliance with the last applicable limit, as would
ordinarily be the case.
Goldman’s risk managers continually assigned the Mortgage Department new “temporary” VAR
limits large enough to accommodate whatever risk levels resulted from the Department’s trading. 
Mr. Birnbaum later described this pattern as the risk area’s “policy to just keep increasing ou[r]
limit.”

The first quarter of 2007 is illustrative of the pattern.  During that quarter, the Mortgage

Department’s trading activities exceeded three new VAR limits in as many weeks.  The Mortgage
Department received its new permanent VAR limit of $35 million on February 8, 2007.
  Four 
days later, on February 12, the Department’s VAR hit $49 million.

GS MBS-E-012927198.  It is unclear the extent to which Goldman’s regulators were aware of the Mortgage
Department’s VAR levels.  In November 2007, Goldman met with the Tri-Lateral Review Group, which included the
Federal Reserve Bank, the SEC, and the United Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority, regarding its risk
management during the financial crisis.  Talking points prepared by Goldman personnel for that meeting stated that
with respect to VAR:  “Exposures were managed responsibly by the business units within agreed limits.  Highs were
set in Mortgages ....  Benign P&L allowed for a disciplined but measured response.”11/13/2007 Goldman email, GS

Value at Risk (VaR), prepared by Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations.]

The continual increases in the Mortgage Department’s VAR also had an impact on VAR

for all of Goldman’s trading activities, called “Trading VAR” or “Firmwide VAR.”  Goldman
carefully tracked the amount of its trading VAR that was attributable to the activities of each of its
trading desks or units.  During the first quarter of 2007, its records show that the firm’s Trading
VAR rose from $119 million in the prior quarter to $154 million.
  Goldman has stated that its
Mortgage Department’s activities have historically resulted in only about 2% of the firm’s net
revenues.
about 3% of the Firmwide Trading VAR of $119 million, which is roughly consistent with or
proportionate to the 2% contribution to firmwide net revenues that Goldman has reported.1928

At the end of the first quarter in 2007, however, the Mortgage Department’s VAR of $85

million was contributing a total of 23% to the Firmwide VAR.
Mortgage Department’s percentage contribution to Firmwide VAR continued to rise until it hit an
all-time high of 54% on August 14, 2007, when the Mortgage Department’s VAR reached $110
million on a Firmwide VAR of $165 million.

  During the rest of 2007, the

1929

1930

  

The 54% contribution rate to Firmwide VAR means that the Mortgage Department’s

trading alone accounted for a 54% of total firmwide risk, while all of Goldman’s other trading
activities combined – including all equities, commodities, foreign exchange, and interest rate
instruments – accounted for the rest.  Given the serious financial ramifications of such a large and
highly concentrated position, the decision to allow the Mortgage Department to incur such a high
level of firmwide risk would have required approval at the highest levels of firm management. 
Indeed, it was Goldman’s Operating Committee and its Co-President, Mr. Cohn, who decided in
February and August 2007, respectively, that the Mortgage Department’s VAR had risen too high
and had to be brought down.1931

Because of the net short’s impact on the Mortgage Department and Firmwide VAR levels,
Goldman’s senior executives not only knew about the “big short,” but made frequent inquiries and
exercised frequent control over the Mortgage Department’s activities.
  On August 16, 2007, for
example, Jon Winkelried, who served as Co-President with Mr. Cohn, asked Mr. Sparks:  “Do you
still feel we are being conservative with our marks .... Good time to make sure we’re
conservative.”  Mr. Sparks replied: 

1932

“I try, but it is much harder than you think with all the things we are dealing with –
completely dislocated markets with little price transparency, systems/tools that are not
where they should be, focused controllers (who I think are doing a very good job in a tough
market) and many cooks in the kitchen who like to micro-manage. ...  But I hear your
message.” 

Mr. Winkelried replied:  “I think you should drop the micro manage theme in this
environment.”

Mr. Mullen also expressed concern that the Mortgage Department’s practice of skirting the

normal decisionmaking channels and communicating directly with the Co-Presidents Gary Cohn
and Jon Winkelried, among other very senior officers, could create problems.  When Mr. Birnbaum
drafted the Mortgage Department’s proposal to buy $10 billion in AAA RMBS securities, he sent it
directly to Mr. Cohn and Mr. Winkelried, as well as to his more immediate superiors, Messrs.
Mullen, Montag, and Sparks, among others.  Mr. Mullen wrote to Messrs. Cohn and Winkelried,
the Co-Presidents of Goldman:  “It would help to manage these guys if u would not answer these
guys and keep bouncing them back to Tom and I.”  Mr. Cohn replied:  “Got that and am not
answering,” but then added:  “I do like the idea but you[r] call.”

1934

  

For his part, Mr. Montag was also aware that he and Mr. Mullen were taking a more active
role in the management of the Mortgage Department than they normally would.  Mr. Montag, for
example, was Global Co-Head of Securities for the Americas, which encompassed both the FICC
Division and the Equities Division, and was responsible for numerous departments.  Nonetheless,
he was involved in management decisions regarding the Mortgage Department on a near-daily
basis in 2007.  In August of that year, Mr. Lehman reported to Mr. Sparks that Mr. Montag had
asked:

“how the desk thought about him and mullen being very involved.  I told him we
understood the scrutiny on the business given the overall pressure on our market, large P+L
[profit and loss] and risk swings, etc.”

1935

  

Given the scrutiny by senior executives, the fact that the Mortgage Department’s VAR was

permitted to reach over $113 million in mid-August 2007 – more than three times its permanent
limit – suggests that senior management knew and approved of the magnitude of the risk the
Department incurred.  It also suggests that the net short positions the Mortgage Department took
were proprietary.
they were seeking only the small spread arbitrage available from market-making activities for
customers.  

  Goldman’s senior executives would have no reason to take such large risks if

On August 9, 2007, Mr. Birnbaum received a note from the Department’s risk managers

indicating that the Department’s temporary VAR limit might not be extended, which would reverse
the prior policy of continually extending temporary limits:

“–Temporary MTG [Mortgage Department] SPG VaR limit of $110mm expired on
8/7/2007[.]
–MTG SPG is over its permanent VaR limit of $35mm.”1942

Mr. Birnbaum told the Subcommittee that he read the note as an indication that the temporary
trading limit would not be renewed, and he was being directed to reduce his net short positions to
bring VAR under the permanent limit of $35 million.
Birnbaum sent an email to the ABS Desk trader, Mr. Salem:

  On the same day, August 9, Mr.

1943

“Are you getting any more heat to cut/cover risk?  These VAR numbers are ludicrous, btw. 
 
Completely overestimated for SPG trading, underestimated for other mortgage desks.”

1944

Mr. Salem replied that he had “waved in ~120mm in bbb and bbb- protection in the last 2 days,”
which covered shorts, so he felt no heat about covering.

  Mr. Birnbaum said:

1945

“I just asked b/c I saw the note about mortgages dropping back down to a permanent limit
of 35mm (which we are way over).  This would mark a change of their recent policy to just
keep increasing ou[r] limit.  Makes me a little nervous that we may be told to do something

Mr. Birnbaum explained to the Subcommittee that by the phrase, “be told to do something
stupid,” he meant being ordered by senior Goldman leadership to cover all of the desk’s lucrative
BBB and BBB- short positions immediately.
  Mr. Birnbaum and others were reluctant to cover
all of SPG Trading’s BBB/BBB- shorts, because they believed the ABX Index for BBB and BBB-
rated RMBS securities would fall further in coming months, so covering the entire short
immediately would amount to leaving significant money on the table.

The dates on which Goldman senior executives ordered the Mortgage Department to reduce

its VAR – on February 21 and August 21 – were within two weeks before the end of Goldman’s
fiscal quarters.  In each case, the result was an immediate drop in VAR through the end of the
quarter.  In February 2007, the Department’s VAR dropped from $92 million to $81 million by the
end of the quarter.  In August 2007, the Department’s VAR dropped even more sharply, from a
record high of over $110 million to $79.7 million by the end of the quarter.
Firmwide VAR figures that resulted from the Mortgage Department’s VAR reductions were
publicly reported in Goldman’s quarterly financial reports.1957

(h)  Profiting From the Big Short

In the third quarter of 2007, Goldman posted financial results showing that it had shorted
the subprime mortgage market and profited from its net short position.  After posting those third
quarter financial results, Goldman continued to trumpet its success, both inside and outside the
firm.  

Third Quarter Financials.  On September 20, 2007, Goldman announced record net

revenues of $12.3 billion for its third quarter.
financial analysts on Goldman’s third quarter results, Goldman’s CFO, David Viniar, highlighted
the performance of the Mortgage Department: 

  On September 19, 2007, in a conference call with

1958

“Let me also address Mortgages specifically.  The mortgage sector continues to be
challenged and there was a broad decline in the value of mortgage inventory during the
third quarter.  As a result, we took significant markdowns on our long inventory positions
during the quarter, as we had in the previous two quarters.  However, our risk bias in that
market was to be short and that net short position was profitable.”1959

Goldman also issued a press release about its third quarter earnings that mentioned mortgages:

“Net revenues in mortgages were also significantly higher, despite continued deterioration
in the market environment.  Significant losses on non-prime loans and securities were more
than offset by gains on short mortgage positions.”1960

for its Board of Directors, highlighting the Mortgage Department’s record profits:   “[W]e were
overall net short the mortgage market and thus had very strong results.”

1961

  

In early October, the Mortgage Department held an internal Global Townhall to discuss its
third quarter profits in detail.  In a draft of the presentation he prepared for the Townhall, Mortgage
Department head Daniel Sparks reported that global mortgages generated aggregate net revenues of
$741 million, a 152% increase over the same quarter in the prior year, while benefitting from a
“proprietary short.”
wrote:

  Under the heading of “Performance Drivers (Net Revenues),” Mr. Sparks

1962

“SPG Trading: +2.04bn [up] $1.92bn vs. Q3 2006
– The desk benefited from a proprietary short in CDO and RMBS single names
– Additionally, we captured P&L [profit & loss] on spread widening [price
declines] in various indices”1963

To put the SPG Trading Desk’s performance in perspective, it had generated $80 million in
the third quarter of 2006, a big year for mortgage related products, but in the third quarter of 2007,
an exceptionally poor year for mortgage related products, Goldman’s SPG Trading Desk generated
$2.04 billion in net revenues – nearly 25 times more.  SPG Trading’s $2.04 billion in net revenues
was offset by other mortgage related losses, including losses from the CDO Origination,
Residential Credit, and Residential Prime Desks, but left an aggregate net profit of $741 million for
the Mortgage Department as a whole – more than twice the comparable quarter net profit of $294
million in the prior year.
  The $2.04 billion in net revenues from the SPG Desk accounted for
over 16% of Goldman’s overall net revenues of $12.3 billion in the third quarter of 2007.  The
$741 million in net revenues for the Mortgage Department as a whole contributed about 6% of the
firm’s total net revenues of $12.3 billion for the third quarter, which was three times the
department’s historical average contribution of about 2% to net revenue.1965

Later in October 2007, Goldman’s Chief Risk Officer, Craig Broderick, discussed the

Mortgage Department’s performance before an internal Goldman audience:

“So what happened to us?  A quick word on our own market and credit risk performance in
this regard.  In market risk – you saw in our 2nd and 3rd qtr results that we made money
despite our inherently long positions.  – because starting early in ‘07 our mortgage trading
desk started putting on big short positions, mostly using the ABX index, which is a family
of indices designed to replicate cash bonds.  And did so in enough quantity that we were net
short, and made money (substantial money in the 3rd quarter) as the subprime market
weakened.  (This remains our position today).”1969

Goldman’s net short positions were also featured in the internal self-evaluations that

Mortgage Department personnel were required to prepare and which they expected to be read by
their supervisors.  In these self-evaluations, which were completed in September 2007, two months
before Goldman’s fiscal year end on November 30, 2007, several Mortgage Department traders who
were active in its shorting activities described the profits produced by the Department’s net shorts. 
Mr. Birnbaum, the senior ABX trader, wrote: 

“As a co-head of ABS and SPG trading, my performance in 2007 has been my best ever by
any objective measure:  1. P&L. YTD:  ABS synthetics: $2.5Bln, ABS: $2.0Bln, SPG
Trading: $3.0Bln, all #1 on the street by a wide margin, #2 in the world trading subprime
risk (behind Paulson Partners).”

1970

  

His self-evaluation showed that the SPG Trading Desk alone generated profits of $3 billion.

(nearly $3bb to date). ...  The contributions to the $3bb of SPG Trading profits and $2bb of

Mr. Salem, one of the ABS traders, wrote:

of 2006 and layout the game plan to put on an enormous directional short. The results of that
are obvious.”

Mr. Salem went on to outline estimated profits from four specific trading strategies pursued by the
ABS Desk that generated profits totaling $3.75 billion.

In these three internal documents, key Mortgage Department personnel involved in

constructing the Department’s net short positions describe the profits generated by those net shorts
as “#1 on the street by a wide margin,” “extraordinary,” and “an enormous directional short” that
produced $3.7 billion in profits for the firm. 

Statements to Regulators.  Goldman also described its short positions and the profits they
produced to its regulators.  In October 2007, Goldman sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange
Commission answering questions about its trading activities and reporting that it had been “net
short” during “most of 2007”:

“[W]e are active traders of mortgage securities and loans and . . . we may choose to take a
directional view of the market ....  For example, during most of 2007, we maintained a net
short sub-prime position and therefore stood to benefit from declining prices in the mortgage
market.”1975

In November 2007, in another letter to the SEC, Goldman explained further:

“During most of 2007, we maintained a net short subprime position with the use of
derivatives, including ABX index contracts and single name CDS which hedged [our] long
cash exposure.”1976

Also in November 2007, in talking points prepared for a meeting with the Tri-Lateral

Review Group, which included the Federal Reserve Bank, the SEC, and the United Kingdom’s
Financial Services Authority, Goldman wrote:  “[W]e were able to maintain a short throughout the
year.”

  Goldman also wrote:

1977

“The press and others have discussed an anticipated Q4 [2007 fourth quarter] write-down for
GS.  Our remaining long subprime exposure totals $695 million, inclusive of whole loans
and CDO positions.  However, we’re net short – as we have been throughout 2007. 
Accordingly, we have nothing to write down.”1978

Public Statements.  Goldman also discussed its net short and related profits in public

settings.  In November 2007, the Bloomberg news service reported that Goldman’s CEO, Lloyd
Blankfein, told a public audience at a securities industry conference that Goldman was, and would
continue to be, net short the subprime markets:

“[Mr. Blankfein] said the firm is still betting that mortgage-backed assets and collateralized
debt obligations will drop. ... ‘Given that point of view, we continue to be net short in these
markets.’”

responding to questions about the Mortgage Department’s performance in a fourth quarter
conference call with analysts.  Goldman’s public statement outlined the steps it took to reduce its
subprime mortgage inventory and related subprime risks in late 2006 and early 2007, characterizing
these “proactive” steps as part of its ordinary risk management efforts.  Goldman went on to state: 
“[O]ne should not be led to believe that we went through this period unscathed and somehow
significantly profited from a ‘bet’ on the downturn in mortgage markets.”
  After noting that
significant writedowns in the value of its long mortgage inventory had resulted in a “weak” second
quarter for mortgages, Goldman wrote:

1983

“[D]uring the third quarter we were able to make money on mortgages as a result of our net
short position.  As a consequence, we believe that we are well-positioned to
opportunistically participate in the inevitable restructuring of the mortgage market.”1984

Despite denying earlier in its statement that it significantly profited from a “bet” against a downturn
in mortgage markets, Goldman wrote that, in the third quarter of 2007, it had profited from a “net
short position” on mortgages.  A “net short position” is, in essence,  a bet on a downturn in the
relevant market, and Goldman’s bet was “able to make money.”

In contrast, other major Wall Street banks reported losses in the third quarter of 2007,

472

  

1990

primarily due to multi-billion-dollar writedowns in the value of their subprime mortgage related
assets.
  Goldman had not only profited from its net shorts, but had also sold off the bulk of its
subprime mortgage assets earlier and at higher prices than many other banks.  After observing the
losses and writedowns suffered by other Wall Street banks, Mr. Viniar wrote: “Tells you what
might be happening to people without the big short.”

1991

At one point, Mr. Birnbaum also contrasted Goldman’s performance with its competitors:

“Results out of DB, Citi, UBS, Bear, Lehman etc. all bear evidence that we were far ahead
of our competition in marking down positions and moving CDO risk before the market
cratered and came to a standstill post-BSAM [Bear Stearns Asset Management].”1992

All of these explanations point to actions taken by Goldman to transfer the risks of its own
subprime mortgage inventory to others, including many of its own customers, before they became
fully aware of the risks entailed in the products Goldman was marketing to them.

Goldman Denials.  In late 2007, Goldman spoke openly of shorting the subprime mortgage
market and that its net short position was profitable.  Afterward, as mortgage losses erupted into a
full blown financial crisis in the United States and abroad, Goldman began to downplay and even
deny the size of its short position, its proprietary nature, and the profits it generated for the firm.1993

Goldman had not been the only market participant to profit from a large net short position in

mortgage related products.  Other investors also aggressively shorted the mortgage market and
profited from their short positions.  A particularly large short position taken by one hedge fund –
Goldman’s customer, the Paulson Credit Opportunity Fund of Paulson & Co. Inc. – netted billions
of dollars in what was later characterized as “the greatest trade ever.”
  Mr. Birnbaum, however,
had described Goldman’s own massive net short position as the “greatest trade ever” as early as July

products business demonstrates.

– Goldman Sachs did not engage in some type of massive ‘bet’ against our clients.  The risk

On April 7, 2010, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Co-President Gary Cohn made

similar assertions in a letter to shareholders contained in Goldman’s Annual Report:

474

– “The firm did not generate enormous net revenues or profits by betting against residential
mortgage-related products, as some have speculated; rather our relatively early risk
reduction resulted in our losing less money that we otherwise would have when the
residential housing market began to deteriorate rapidly ....

–Although Goldman Sachs held various positions in residential mortgage-related products in
2007, our short positions were not a ‘bet against our clients.’  Rather, they served to offset
our long positions.”2003

At the Subcommittee hearing, Mr. Blankfein repeated the same claims.  He testified:

“Much has been said about the supposedly massive short Goldman Sachs had on the U.S.
housing market.  The fact is, we were not consistently or significantly net short the market in
residential mortgage-related products in 2007 and 2008.  Our performance in our residential
market-related business confirms this.  During the 2 years of the financial crisis, while
profitable overall, Goldman Sachs lost approximately $1.2 billion from our activities in the
residential housing market.  We didn’t have a massive short against the housing market and
we certainly did not bet against our clients.  Rather, we believe that we managed our risk as
our shareholders and our regulators would expect.”2004

Mr. Viniar, Goldman’s Chief Financial Officer, testified:

“[A]cross 2007, we were primarily, although not consistently short, and it was not a large
short. ... The short positions themselves made a lot of money in 2007, but they offset long
positions that lost a lot of money in 2007.”2005

Goldman’s denials of its net short positions in the subprime mortgage market, and the large
profits produced by those net short positions, are directly contradicted by its own financial records
and internal communications, as well as its own public statements in 2007, and are not credible.

How Goldman Created and Failed to Manage Conflicts of Interest 
in its Securitization Activities

In the years leading up to the financial crisis, Goldman was an active trader in the mortgage
market, buying and selling a variety of mortgage related assets, including RMBS, CDO, ABX, and

CDS instruments, as described in the prior section.  In addition, Goldman was one of the leaders in
mortgage related securitizations, helping to originate both CDO and RMBS securities.  Goldman’s
2006 and 2007 securitization activities are the focus of this section.

In 2006 and 2007, Goldman originated 27 CDOs and 93 RMBS securitizations with a total

  Goldman designed the structure of each securitization, including the

value of about $100 billion.
number of tranches, how the payments would be allocated, and the projected rate of return or
“coupon rate” that would be paid to investors.  In some, Goldman selected the assets to be
securitized; in others, it hired a portfolio selection agent or collateral manager to help select the
assets and manage the portfolio.  For each securitization, Goldman typically housed all of the assets
to be securitized in a “warehouse” account until the transaction was ready to go to market.  The
assets in the warehouse accounts were then included in Goldman’s balance sheet.  Goldman also
typically worked with one or more credit rating agencies to obtain favorable credit ratings for the
proposed securities.  

In addition, Goldman typically established a domestic and an offshore corporation to act as
the nominal owners of the securitization’s incoming cash, assets, and collateral securities; to serve
as the actual issuers of the securities; and to perform certain administrative services.  Goldman also
established arrangements for the servicing of any underlying mortgages.  In some CDOs, Goldman
or its affiliate provided additional services as well, acting in such roles as the collateral securities
selection agent, the collateral put provider, or the liquidation agent charged with selling impaired
assets.  Goldman also used its global sales force to market its securities to investors around the
world, typically selling Goldman-issued CDO securities through a private placement and RMBS
securities through a public offering.

In late 2006, when subprime residential mortgages began to incur higher than expected rates
of delinquency, fraud, and default, and its inventory of mortgage related assets began to lose value,
Goldman took a number of actions.  It sold the mortgage related assets in its inventory; returned
poor quality loans to the lenders from which they were purchased and demanded repayment; limited
new RMBS securitizations; sold or securitized the assets in its RMBS warehouse accounts; limited
new CDO securitizations to transactions already in the pipeline; and sold assets from discontinued
CDOs.  

Throughout this process, Goldman made a concerted effort to sell securities from the CDO
and RMBS securitizations it had originated, even when those securities included or referenced poor
quality assets and began losing value.  Many of the CDO and RMBS securities that Goldman sold to
its clients incurred substantial losses.  The widespread losses caused by CDO and RMBS securities
originated by investment banks are a key cause of the financial crisis that affected the global
financial system in 2007 and 2008.

This section of the Report examines how Goldman originated, marketed, and sold its
mortgage related securities, in particular CDO securities, during late 2006 and in 2007, as the
mortgage market deteriorated and as Goldman was profiting from its own net short positions.  The
section begins with general information about Goldman’s securitization activities, followed by
detailed case studies of four Goldman-originated CDOs:  Hudson 1, Anderson, Timberwolf I, and
Abacus 2007-AC1.  

The evidence discloses troubling and sometimes abusive practices which show, first, that
Goldman knowingly sold high risk, poor quality mortgage products to clients around the world,
saturating financial markets with complex, financially engineered instruments that magnified risk
and losses when their underlying assets began to fail.  Second, it shows multiple conflicts of interest
surrounding Goldman’s securitization activities, including its use of CDOs to transfer billions of
dollars of risk to investors, assist a favored client make a $1 billion gain at the expense of other
clients, and produce its own proprietary gains at the expense of the clients to whom Goldman sold
its CDO securities. 

Under Goldman’s sales policies and procedures, an affirmative action by Goldman

investment.
broker-dealer recommending an investment to a customer, Goldman had an obligation to sell
investments that were suitable for any investor and were not designed to fail.  When acting in those
roles and affirmatively soliciting clients to buy securities, Goldman also had an obligation to
disclose material information that a reasonable investor would want to know, including material
conflicts of interest or adverse interests in connection with its sale of a security.

2008

  

In 2006 and 2007, when selling subprime CDO securities to customers, Goldman did not

always disclose that the securities contained or referenced assets Goldman believed would perform
poorly, and that the securities themselves were rapidly losing value.  Goldman also did not disclose
that the firm had built a large net short position betting that CDO and RMBS securities similar to
the ones it was selling would lose value.  In the case of the Hudson, Anderson, and Timberwolf
CDOs, Goldman failed to disclose to potential investors that it was shorting the very securities
Goldman was selling to them.  In the case of the Abacus CDO, Goldman failed to disclose to
potential investors that it had allowed an interested party to help select the CDO assets and act as
the sole short party, with the expectation that the selected assets would lose value and that party
would make money at the expense of the long investors to whom Goldman had sold the securities. 
Goldman created these and other conflicts of interest with its clients in connection with its CDO
activities.

(a)  Background

477

To understand Goldman’s securitization activities, this section provides general background
about its CDO and RMBS business and how Goldman changed its securitization activities when the
mortgage market began to deteriorate in late 2006.

(i)  Goldman’s Securitization Business

The Goldman Mortgage Department originated CDOs through two different desks within

the Department.  Approximately half of Goldman’s CDOs were originated by its CDO Origination
Desk, which assembled the assets, structured the CDOs, and worked with the Goldman sales force
to market the resulting securities to a broad range of investors.  The CDO Origination Desk was
headed by Peter Ostrem from 2006 until May 2007, after which all remaining Goldman-originated
CDOs were transferred to the Structured Product Group (SPG) Trading Desk and were overseen by
David Lehman.  

Goldman’s other CDOs, which were part of a series issued under the name of Abacus, were
originated by the Correlation Trading Desk, which was a sub-desk of the SPG Trading Desk.  The
Correlation Trading Desk specialized in arranging customized trades for investors and used the
Abacus series of CDOs as one of its investment alternatives.  The Correlation Trading Desk was
headed by Jonathan Egol.  The CDO Origination and Correlation Trading Desks were located on the
same floor as the other SPG Trading Desks.

RMBS securitizations were handled by the Residential Whole Loan Trading Desk, headed

by Kevin Gasvoda.  Sub-desks within the Residential Whole Loan Trading area oversaw the
purchase of residential loan pools, constructed the RMBS securitizations, and worked with the
Goldman sales force to sell the resulting securities to investors. 

After a desk originated a CDO or RMBS securitization and sold the Goldman-originated
securities for the first time, all secondary trading of the securities was handled by the Structured
Products Group’s Asset-Backed Security (ABS) Desk.  In mid-2007, Goldman shut down its CDO
Origination Desk and directed the ABS Desk to sell all remaining Goldman-originated CDO
securities, in addition to conducting the secondary trading it normally handled.

Daniel Sparks, as head of the Mortgage Department, oversaw all of Goldman’s CDO and

RMBS origination activities. Mr. Sparks reported at times to Jonathan Sobel, the prior department
head, and Richard Ruzika, then head of Commodities Trading.  He also worked with Justin
Gmelich, a managing director asked to help him run the Department on a short term basis.  Mr.
Sparks also had frequent contact with more senior Goldman executives, including Thomas Montag,
then global co-head of Securities Trading, and Donald Mullen, then head of Credit Trading.  On
occasion, he also received directives from Chief Financial Officer David Viniar and Co-Presidents
Gary Cohn and Jon Winkelried.  

(ii)  Goldman’s Negative Market View

478

As established earlier in the Report, all of Goldman’s securitization activities from 2006 to
2007 took place against the backdrop of a subprime mortgage market that, in Goldman’s view, was
in distress and worsening.  

On December 7, 2006, for example, Mr. Sparks sent this gloomy assessment to senior

executive Thomas Montag:

“Generally, originators are struggling with EPDs [early payment defaults] which require
them to buy back loans and take losses – thinly capitalized firms can’t take much of it. 
Lower margins and volumes are also causing pain.  Ownit [a mortgage originator] ... closed
Monday.  Premiums for these originators – all of whom are for sale – are rapidly falling. ... 
Likely fall-out – more originators close and spreads in related sectors widen.”

2009

  

A week later, on December 13, 2006, Mr. Sparks repeated his negative view of the subprime

mortgage market before senior Goldman executives on the Firmwide Risk Committee.  The
committee minutes described his report as follows:

“Dan Sparks:  Noted the stress in the subprime market; Concern around ‘06 originators, as
two more failed last week; Concern around early payment defaults, $5BN in loans to
subprime borrowers, warehouse lines to 6 subprime lenders, and $16MM in ‘06 residual
positions and alt-a and subprime residual positions from ‘04-‘05; Street aggressively putting
back early payment defaults to originators thereby affecting the originator’s business. 
Rumors around more failures are in the market.”2010

On December 14, 2006, CFO David Viniar held a meeting with senior Mortgage

Department executives, reviewed their mortgage related holdings, and directed them to offset the
risk posed by declining values.
  The Mortgage Department then initiated its first multi-billion-
dollar net short positions in 2007, essentially betting that subprime mortgage related assets would
fall in value.  

2011

In early 2007, Mr. Sparks made increasingly dire predictions about the decline in the

subprime mortgage market and issued emphatic instructions to his staff about the need to get rid of
subprime loans and other assets.  On February 8, 2007, for example, Mr. Sparks wrote:

“Subprime environment – bad and getting worse.  Everyday is a major fight for some aspect
of the business (think whack-a-mole). . . . [P]ain is broad (including investors in certain GS-
issued deals).”2012

On February 14, 2007, Mr. Sparks wrote some notes to himself:

“Bad week in subprime

collateral performance on loans was poor – we took a write-down on second lien deals and
on the scratch and dent book last week ...

Synthetics market got hammered – around 150 [basis points] wider ...

Originators are really in a bad spot.  Thinly capitalized, highly levered, dealing with
significant loan putbacks, some with retained credit risk positions, now having trouble
selling loans above par when it cost them 2 points to produce.

What is the next area of contagion.”2013

That same day, February 14, 2007, Mr. Sparks exchanged emails with Goldman’s Co-

President Jon Winkelried about the deterioration in the subprime market:

Mr. Winkelried: “Another downdraft?”

Mr. Sparks: “Very large – it’s getting messy. ...  Bad news everywhere.  Novastar bad
earnings and 1/3 of market cap gone immediately.  Wells [Fargo] laying off 300 subprime
staff and home price appreciation data showed for first time lower prices on homes over year
broad based.”2014

On February 26, 2007, when Mr. Montag asked him about two CDO  transactions being

assembled by the CDO Origination Desk, Timberwolf and Point Pleasant, Mr. Sparks expressed his
concern about both:

Mr. Montag:  cdo squared–how big and how dangerous

On March 3, 2007, Mr. Sparks made notes after a telephone call:  “Things we need to do ....

Risk Committee on accelerating problems in the subprime mortgage market:

  On March 7, 2007, Mr. Sparks again reported to Goldman’s Firmwide

2016

“– ‘Game Over’ – accelerating meltdown for subprime lenders such as Fremont and New
Century.
– The Street is highly vulnerable . ...  Current strategies are to ‘put back’ inventory and
liquidate positions.
– The Mortgage business is currently closing down every subprime exposure possible.”2017

On March 8, 2007, Mr. Sparks emailed several senior executives, including Mr. Viniar and Mr.
Cohn about “Mortgage Risk”:   “[W]e are trying to close everything down, but stay on the short
side.”2018

Other Mortgage Department personnel gave similarly bleak assessments of the subprime

mortgage market.  As early as January 2007, Jonathan Egol, head of the Correlation Trading Desk,
wrote to a colleague expressing his clients’ views:  “The mkt is dead.”
  In February 2007, when
discussing plans to issue an Abacus CDO with a Correlation Desk Trader, Fabrice Tourre, Mr. Egol
repeated that assessment as his own:

2019

Mr. Egol:  [T]he paulson trade may already be dead (although given it is baa2 it may still
have a decent shot).

Mr. Tourre:  Don’t think the Paulson trade is dead.  Supersenior pretty much done with
ACA, AAAs could be placed in 2 shots, this is sufficient.  Remember we make $$$ per

stoppage – either via buyer strike or dramatic rating agency change.”  Mr. Sparks was referring to
the possibility that Goldman would be unable to securitize and sell its remaining subprime mortgage
related inventory by repackaging it into RMBS and CDOs for sale to customers.  His concern was
either that buyers would refuse to purchase such products (“buyer strike”), or that the ratings
agencies might realize the poor quality and high risks associated with these products and downgrade
them so they could not be sold with AAA ratings (“dramatic rating agency change”).  In essence,
Mr. Sparks was worried about Goldman’s being left with a large inventory of unsold and unsaleable
subprime mortgage related assets when the market finally collapsed.2022

At the same time Goldman personnel were expressing these negative views of the

securitization business, the Mortgage Department was building its large net short positions in the
first and third quarters of the year.

(iii)  Goldman’s Securitization Sell Off   

In response to the December 14, 2006 meeting at which CFO David Viniar ordered the

Mortgage Department to offset the risk associated with its mortgage related holdings, the
Department initiated an intensive effort to sell off the subprime RMBS and CDO securities and
other assets in its inventory and warehouse accounts.

As described earlier, on the same day as the Viniar meeting, December 14, 2006, Kevin

Gasvoda, head of the Mortgage Department’s Residential Whole Loan Trading Desk, instructed his
staff to undertake an immediate, concerted effort to sell the whole loans and RMBS securities in
Goldman’s inventory and warehouse accounts, focusing on RMBS securities from Goldman-
originated securitizations.

values for its assets, but also effectively reduced the size of Goldman’s “long” position in subprime
mortgage related assets.  As Mr. Ruzika wrote to Mr. Cohn:  “working with Dan to uncover exactly

Department intensified its efforts to identify and return defaulted or otherwise deficient loans to the

In the years leading up to the financial crisis, most subprime loan purchase agreements

provided that if a loan experienced an early payment default (EPD), meaning the borrower failed to
make a payment within three months of the loan’s purchase, or if the loan breached certain
representations or warranties, such as representations related to the loan’s characteristics or
documentation, the loan could be returned or “put back” to the seller which was then obligated to
repurchase it.  In late 2006, as subprime loans began to experience accelerated rates of EPDs and
fraud,
 Wall Street firms began to intensify their efforts to return those loans for refunds.  Some
subprime lenders began to experience financial distress due to unprecedented waves of repurchase
requests that drained their cashflows.2035

Although Goldman, either directly or through a third party due diligence firm, routinely

  
conducted due diligence reviews of the mortgage loan pools it bought from lenders or third party
brokers for use in its securitizations, those reviews generally examined only a sample of the loans

different mortgage classes, such as subprime, Alt A, and prime loans.  These default rates, however, were based in
large part on past loan underwriting practices and loan types that bore little resemblance to the loans issued in the
years leading up to the financial crisis, as explained in Chapter V of this Report.  In 2006, subprime loans began to
experience higher than anticipated EPD rates, and  lenders were hit by unanticipated repurchase demands they could
not afford to pay.  The first EPD-related mortgage lender failures occurred in late 2006, and bankruptcies continued

purchased loan pools with the expectation that they would incur a certain rate of defaults.  In late
2006, however, like other Wall Street firms, Goldman began to see much higher than anticipated
delinquency and default rates in the loan pools in its inventory and warehouse accounts, and in the
subprime RMBS and CDO securitizations it originated.
  Defaulted loans generally could not be
sold or securitized, and had to be terminated through foreclosure proceedings or sold in so-called
“scratch and dent” pools that generally produced less money than the loans cost to buy.  In addition,
defaulted loans meant that the borrowers who took out those loans stopped making loan payments
to the securitized loan pool, reducing the cashflow into the related securities.  RMBS and CDO
securities whose underlying assets incurred high rates of loan delinquencies and defaults
experienced reduced cashflows, lost value, and sometimes failed altogether, resulting in substantial
losses for investors.

2037

In early 2007, Goldman’s Mortgage Department initiated an intensive review of the loans in
its inventory, warehouse accounts, and RMBS and CDO securitizations, to identify deficient loans
and return them for refunds.  On February 2, 2007, Mr. Sparks reported to senior Goldman
executives Messrs. Viniar, Montag, and Ruzika that obtaining refunds from the loan originators
would be “a battle”:

“The team is working on putting loans in the deals back to the originators (New Century,
WAMU, and Fremont – all real counterparties), as there seem to be issues potentially
including some fraud at origination, but resolution will take months and be contentious. ... 
The put backs will be a battle.”

2038

  

  Goldman or a third party due diligence firm it hired typically examined a sample of the loans.  Based on the

2036
number of problem loans found in the sample, Goldman or the due diligence firm extrapolated the total percentage of
problem loans likely to be contained in the pool.  This information was then factored into the price Goldman paid for
the pool.  Any specific loans identified in the sampling process as deficient were generally returned to the lender for
repurchase, but it was rare for an investment bank to review 100% of a pool to identify all of the deficient loans and
return them.  Subcommittee interview of Clayton Holdings (11/9/2010).

Sparks described Goldman’s exposure as follows:

2042

“As for the big 3 originators – Accredited, New Century and Fremont, our real exposure is
in the form of put-back claims.  Basically, if we get nothing back we would lose around
$60mm vs loans on our books (we have a reserve of $30mm) and the loans in the [CDO and
RMBS] trusts could lose around $60mm (we probably suffer about 1/3 of this in ongoing
exposures). ...  Rumor today is that the FBI is in Accredited.”2043

Five days later, on March 12, 2007, Mr. Sparks wrote: “The street is aggressively putting things
back, like a run on the bank before there is no money left to fulfill the obligations.”

2044

  

One of the lenders that was an initial focus of Goldman’s loan repurchase effort was New
Century, a subprime lender whose loans Goldman had used in many Goldman-originated RMBS
securitizations.  After completing a review of one New Century loan pool, an analyst recommended
“putting back 26% of the pool ... if possible.”

four of the loans in the New Century pool had EPDs, were fraudulent, or otherwise breached New
Century’s contractual warranties.  It also implied that about 25% of the expected mortgage
payments might not be made to the relevant RMBS securitization.  Unless the problem loans could
be successfully “put back” to New Century in exchange for a refund, a fail rate of that magnitude
would likely impair the performance of all of the securities dependent upon that pool of mortgages.

Goldman made a total of about $46 million in repurchase requests to Fremont, another
subprime lender for whom Goldman had underwritten multiple securities and which was also
among the five mortgage originators to whom Goldman made the most repurchase requests in 2006
and 2007.
  When Goldman personnel reviewed a loan pool purchased from Fremont, the results
were even worse than for the New Century loans.  Goldman concluded that “on average, about 50%
of about 200 files look to be repurchase obligations.”

the Mortgage Department was keenly aware of the poor quality of many of the loan pools in its

of those loans and selling the resulting RMBS securities to clients.

“ As you know, we own $10mm of the GSAMP 06-S3 M2 bond. ...  We are shocked by how
poorly this bond has performed right ‘out of the gate’ and had asked [Goldman] to send us
the attached ProSupp [Prospectus Supplement].  After having read the ProSupp and
compared it to the termsheet we have several concerns:

*       According to the Prosupp, approximately $2.2mm ... of loans were delinquent when
they were transferred to the trust.  However, there is no mention of delinquent loans
anywhere in the termsheet that was sent to investors when the deal was priced.

*       According to the Prosupp, approximately $3.3mm ... are re-performing loans. 
However, there is no mention of reperforming loans anywhere in the termsheet.

*       Approx. 53.14% of the loans in the deal allow for a Prepayment Premium and that all
Prepayment Premiums collected from borrowers are paid to the Class P certificateholders. 
None of this was disclosed in the termsheet and my concerns are two-fold: (1) The presence
of Prepayment Premiums effects prepayment speeds which affects  ... [the deal’s
performance]; (2) Prepayment Premiums are not staying inside the deal for the benefit of all
investors but are being earmarked for the Class P holder (which is not mentioned in the
termsheet).  Note that ... $1.2mm in Prepayment Premiums has already been paid out to the
Class P holder.

*       ... [T]he servicer must charge off any loan that becomes 180 days delinquent, giving
rise to a Realized Loss inside the deal.  Currently losses are at 9.71% of the original deal
balance, or approximately $48mm despite the fact that the deal is only 11 months old (note
that this figure already exceeds Moody's expec[ta]tion for cumulative losses for the deal
over the ENTIRE LIFE of the deal).  I will also note that there are an additional $57.5mm of
loans in the delinquency pipeline. This seems to indicate significant fraud at either the
borrower or lender level ....

*       ... [A]ny subsequent recoveries on the charged-off loans do not inure to the benefit of
all investors in the deal but ONLY to the Class X1 certificateholder.  This is not mentioned
anywhere in the termsheet.  Who owns the Class X1 notes?  Is that Goldman or an affiliate? 
How much has been recovered so far?  This is a material fact to me especially considering
that loss severities are coming in at around 105% on the charged-off loans.”2064

Reduced RMBS Business.  By the end of 2007, Goldman had substantially reduced its
RMBS securitization business.  In November 2007, in response to a request, Goldman provided
specific data to the SEC about the decrease in its inventory of subprime mortgage loans and RMBS
securities.  Goldman informed the SEC that the value of its subprime loan inventory had dropped
from $7.8 billion on November 24, 2006, to $462 million on August 31, 2007.  Over the same time
period, the value of its inventory of subprime RMBS securities had dropped from $7.2 billion to

Goldman reduced its inventory of subprime loan pools and RMBS securities through

outright sales, writedowns, and its loan repurchase campaign.  It was equally aggressive in reducing
its subprime CDO warehouse inventory.  

In January 2007, after the CDO Origination Desk worked to sell securities from a CDO

called Camber 7, Mr. Sparks wrote to Mr. Montag:  “Need you to send message to peter ostrem and
darryl herrick telling them what a great job they did.  They structured like mad and traveled the
world, and worked their tails off to make some lemonade out of some big old lemons.”2067

In February 2007, the Mortgage Department conducted a review of the CDOs in its

The Mortgage Department rushed several remaining CDOs to market, including Anderson,
   In May

Timberwolf, and Point Pleasant, which issued their securities in March and April 2007.
and June 2007, the Mortgage Department began closing all of its remaining CDO warehouse
accounts and transferring the assets to the SPG Trading Desk for sale.
Lehman reported that the ABS Desk had just sold another $50 million in RMBS securities from the
CDO warehouse accounts for a profit of $1 million, and that: “[o]nly 40mm RMBS A3/A- remain

Aggressive Sales Efforts.  On March 9, 2007, Mr. Sparks emailed a call for “help” to

Goldman’s top sales managers around the world to “sell our new issues – CDOs and RMBS – and
to sell our other cash trading positions.”
  In response, Mr. Sparks and key sales managers had a
dialogue about “reaching the next wave of players here and abroad.”

2075

2076

  

The Goldman sales manager for Europe and the Middle East suggested that Mr. Sparks

focus the CDO sales efforts abroad, because the clients there were not involved in the U.S. housing
market and therefore were “not feeling pain”:

“The key to success in the correlation melt-down 2 years ago was getting new clients/capital
into the opportunity quickly.  Saved/made us a lot of money.  Lots of banks and real money
clients in Europe and middle east and lots of macro hedge funds are not involved and not
feeling pain.  In Europe we need a summary of key opportunities/axes and I will get the team
to focus on.  2-3 most important things plus sales talking points rather than laundry list.”2077

Mr. Ostrem, head of the CDO Origination Desk, agreed with expanding Goldman’s CDO sales
efforts in Europe and the Middle East:  “I agree with [sales manager’s] comments on new clients. 
Middle east, french banks, macro hedge funds could and are making these deals ‘work’
currently.”
Goldman sales force placing a priority on selling securities from the Anderson, Timberwolf, and
Hudson CDOs:

  The following week, Mr. Lehman issued three new sales directives or “axes” to the

“As per [European/Middle East sales manager’s] suggestion last Friday, below are the three
main focus areas for SP CDOs/SPG Trading, including Anderson Mezzanine, Timberwolf

Goldman’s New York sales office forwarded the axe sheet to the European/Middle East sales office
saying: “London – this is for you.”

assets that were from or similar to Goldman’s own inventory.  The Subcommittee examined seven of those CDOs,
and found that 57% of the CDO assets had come from Goldman, including over $3 billion in synthetic assets in
which Goldman was the short party, and therefore stood to profit from a decline in the value of the underlying assets. 
Goldman had unsold securities from a number of these CDOs on its books.

In an additional effort to expand Goldman’s sales effort, the Mortgage Department’s sales

syndicate provided a list of “non-traditional buyers” to the CDO and SPG Trading Desks:

“We have pushed credit sales to identify accounts in the credit space that would follow yield
into the ABS [asset-backed security] CDO market, and tried to uncover some non-traditional
buyers. ...  Below is a list of higher delta accounts uncovered so far; and we continue to push
for leads.  We are working with sales on these accounts to push our axes.”

2081

 

Goldman personnel worked diligently to pitch CDO securities to various clients, internal
documents show.  On March 30, 2007, for example, Fabrice Tourre reported to senior Mortgage
Department executives about his efforts and plans to sell the CDO securities:

“This transaction [Abacus 2007-AC1] has been showed to selected accounts for the past few
weeks.  Those selected accounts had previously declined participating in Anderson mezz,
Point Pleasant and Timberwolfe. ...  Plan would still be to ask sales people to focus on
Anderson mezz, Point Pleasant and Timberwolfe, but if accounts pass on these trades, steer
them towards available tranches in ABACUS 07-AC1 since we make $$$ proportionately
with the notional amount of these tranches sold.  Wanted to make sure everyone is
comfortable with this plan.”2082

In April 2007, the Mortgage Department issued a new directive to its sales force with a list

of new and old CDO securities in its inventory that it wanted sold, including Timberwolf and
Anderson as well as CDOs known as Point Pleasant and Altius.
sales, Mr. Sparks suggested issuing a separate axe for each CDO and offering additional sales
credits:  “Why don’t we go one at at a time with some ginormous credits - for example, let’s double
the current offering of credit for timberwolf.”
  A sales manager responded:  “We have done that
with timberwolf already.  Don’t want to roll out any more focus axes until we get some traction
there but at the same time, don’t want to stop showing inventory.”

contentious point that trading team doesn’t debate it anymore.  The politics around sales credits had become
unbelievable and were a hinderance [sic] to business.”  Mr. Montag replied:  “so you overpay?”).

value of its CDO holdings.
  Goldman needed accurate values, not just to establish its CDO sales
prices, but also to value the CDO securities for collateral purposes and to comply with Goldman’s
policy of using up-to-date market values for all of its holdings.  Mr. Sparks expressed concern that
the value of the remaining CDO assets were rapidly declining, warning one senior executive:  “We
are going to have a very large mark down – multiple hundreds.  Not good.”

On May 11, 2007, Goldman senior executives, including Mr. Cohn and Mr. Viniar, held a

lengthy meeting with Mortgage Department personnel, their risk controllers, and others to develop a
“Gameplan” for a CDO valuation project.

remaining CDO warehouse assets and unsold securities from the Goldman-originated CDOs then
being marketed to clients.

  The Gameplan called for the Mortgage Department,

A few days later, on May 14, 2007, while the CDO valuation project was underway, Mr.

Montag asked Mr. Sparks for an estimate of how much the firm would need to write down the value
of its CDO assets.  Mr. Sparks responded that the “base case from traders is down [$]382
[million].”  He  also wrote:  

“I think we should take the write-down, but market [the CDO securities] at much higher
levels.  I’m a little concerned we are overly negative and ahead of the market, and that we
could end up leaving some money on the table.”

The valuation project’s results were summarized in a presentation dated Sunday, May 20,

CDO warehouse accounts at $1.5 billion, and expressed particular concern about selling $742
million in CDO securities from non Goldman originated CDOs due to “limited liquidity and price
transparency in this space.”  The executive summary stated that since “securitization is no longer a
viable exit, the warehouse collateral will be marked to market on an individual basis.”

  The writedowns were required, in part, because the assets in the CDO warehouses had generally been marked at
cost when purchased or at a value related to the final securitized structure, called “mark-to-securitization-exit.” 
Those valuation methods generally resulted in values well above what the assets would bring if sold individually in a
declining mortgage market.

The CDO valuation project undertaken in May provided clear notice to Goldman senior

management at the highest levels that its CDO assets had fallen sharply in value, and that despite
their lower value, the Mortgage Department planned to aggressively market them to customers.  In
an earlier draft of the presentation, the Mortgage Department had also stated that it expected
Goldman’s CDO and CDO  securities “to underperform”:

“The complexity of the CDO^2 product and the poor demand for CDOs in general has made
this risk difficult to sell and the desk expects it to underperform.”2096

011057632 (mortgage credit business shared with SPG Trading Desk “a fairly lengthy list of accounts that are
considered to be ‘key’”).  In December 2006, the Correlation Trading Desk drew up a list of target customers for
2007:  the “proposed top 20 correlation customer list.” 12/29/2006 email from Fabrice Tourre, “Last call–any other
comments on the proposed top 20 correlation customer list,” GS MBS-E-002527843, Hearing Exhibit 4/27-61. 
Mr. Tourre issued a “last call” for comments on the list and suggested focusing on “buy-and-hold rating-base buyers”
who might be more profitable for the desk than more sophisticated and demanding hedge fund customers:  

“[T]his list might be a little skewed towards sophisticated hedge funds with which we should not expect to
make too much money since (a) most of the time they will be on the same side of the trade as we will, and
(b) they know exactly how things work and will not let us work for too much $$$, vs. buy-and-hold rating-
based buyers who we should be focused on a lot more to make incremental $$$ next year.”

The proposed top 20 list identified a number of European accounts, as well as customers who had purchased asset
backed security products from Goldman in the past.

The reference to “buy and hold, ratings-based buyers” was to conservative financial institutions, often

insurance companies or pension funds, that tended to hold their investments indefinitely or until maturity, some of
which were limited to holding investments with AAA or other investment grade credit ratings.  Many of these buyers
tended to rely on the AAA rating as a “seal of approval” signaling that the rated instrument offered predictable, safe
returns.  Many viewed the AAA rating as, in effect, all these buyers thought they needed to know about the CDO
securities they were purchasing.  See, e.g.,11/13/2007 Goldman email, GS MBS-E-010023525 (attachment,
11/14/2007 “Tri-Lateral Combined Comments,” GS MBS-E-010135693-715 at 713) (“Investors in subprime related
securities, especially higher rated bonds, have historically relied significantly on bond ratings particularly when
securities are purchased by structured investing vehicles.”).  But as one press article explained:  “CDO ratings may
mislead investors because they can obscure the risk of default, especially compared with similar ratings for bonds,
says Darrell Duffie, a professor of finance at Stanford Graduate School of Business in California, who’s paid by
Moody’s to advise the company on credit risk.  ‘You can’t compare these CDO ratings with corporate bond ratings,’
Duffie says.  ‘These ratings mean something else – entirely.’”   See 5/31/2007 email to David Lehman and others,
“CDO Boom Masks Subprime Losses,” GS MBS-E-001865723 at 733.  The article pointed out that the lowest grade
of corporate bonds rated by Moody’s had a default rate of 2.2%, while the default rate for CDOs with the same rating
was 24%.  Id.

“I know what he means.  If you talk to people knowledgeable about cdos, you will find that
external perception of GS franchise in this space is much lower than Sparks and Sobel
believed.  Over the last 2 years, GS [Goldman Sachs] is perceived to be a bottom quartile
abs [asset-backed security] cdo underwriter and to have done several poor deals.  There is a
reason [the CDO desk] didn’t sell much paper.  The fact that [the CDO desk] was basically
giving money away in these no-fee principal deals and could still only get TCW, GSC (both
street wh—e managers) and some start up managers to work with GS is a stain that will take
time to remove.  The HG [high-grade] deals in particular are very poor.  I thought the alladin
deals had some potential but fortius 2 is going to be a real mess.

“These are not just my views – they are from customers whose views resonate in the market. 
Sales people have just been too timid internally or not engaged enough with their accounts
to provide accurate feedback.  It pains me to say it but citi, ubs, db [Deutsche Bank], lehman
and ms [Morgan Stanley] have much stronger franchises – among large dealers only ML
[Merrill Lynch] is more reviled than [Goldman’s] business. ...

The CDO valuation project presentation given the next day, May 20, 2007, recommended
that all assets from the CDO warehouse accounts be transferred to the SPG Trading Desk for sale. 
A CDO “transition book” was created to account for profits and losses from some of the assets, and
the transfer took place the following week.
  In addition, by June 1, 2007, Goldman eliminated the
CDO Origination Desk as a separate entity, and moved all of the remaining Goldman-originated
CDO securities to the SPG Trading Desk, where Mr. Lehman was based.
  As a result, the SPG
Trading Desk, which was a secondary trading desk and had little experience with the greater
disclosure obligations involved with selling newly minted securities, became solely responsible for
selling all Goldman-originated CDO securities.  

2105

2104

Renewed Sales Efforts.  After the transfer of the CDO assets, the SPG Trading Desk began

to work with the Goldman sales force to identify potential customers and sell the CDO products. 
On May 24, 2007, a Goldman salesperson contacted Messrs. Sparks and Lehman regarding two
potential customers interested in Timberwolf and Point Pleasant securities.
  With respect to one
customer, the salesman wrote that it was “[n]ot experts in this space at all but [I] made them a lot of
money in correlation dislocation and will do as I suggest.”  With respect to the second customer, the
Goldman salesperson wrote that the customer had “just raised another $1bln for their ABS [asset
backed security] fund and they are very short the ABX so are natural buyers of our axe.”

2107

A couple of weeks before the CDO valuation project, Goldman’s Australia sales

2108

representative, George Maltezos, announced he had found a potential Australian buyer for a
Goldman CDO being constructed by the Correlation Desk:  “I think I found white elephant, flying
pig and unicorn all at once.”
  On the same day the project identified Basis Capital as a primary
target for CDO sales, May 20, 2007, Mr. Maltezos sent Mr. Lehman an email saying he would
contact the Basis principals as soon as they returned from a business trip the following day.2109
  

On May 24, 2007, the CDO sales dry spell ended, when Paramax Capital Group, a U.S.

CDO Sales in Asia.  On June 11, 2007, Mr. Lehman received a note from the Mortgage
Department’s sales syndicate desk asking whether the directive listing high priority CDO sales
could be sent to the Japan sales office, which oversaw sales throughout Asia:

“Know there was sensitivity w/ sending this out, but asia sales management is asking again. 
Do you want to consider sending more broadly for asia sales or do you want to stick with the
more targeted approach?”2112

The Japan sales group wrote that the head of the Japan office “is saying that we need it to go more
broadly to all Sales at least in Japan.  Given her request twice now and her help in getting focus, 
think we should at least push this in Japan.”
  Mr. Lehman responded: “Fine  – let’s send to all
Japan sales then.”2114

2113

The Japan sales office responded to the new directive with several quick sales.  On June 13,

2007, the Japan sales office sent out this celebratory note:

“We have moved over $250mm of SP CDO axes to account in Japan, Australia and
Korea over the past 2+ weeks.  These are HUGE orders for the firm as they have helped
reduce balance sheet risk and further exhibits the importance of the Asia franchise to the
global Structured Products Group business.  Note that in line with these trades we have
paid out over $14mm of gross credits – this is clearly the top focus for us now in SP
[Structured Product] CDO space. ...  Call the SPG Asia desk in Tokyo for updated axes and
offer levels.  We hope to trade another $20mm of CDO^2 risk with a Japanese account in
the coming week+.  Thanks.”2115

Mr. Lehman replied: “Thx for sending this out.”

2116

  

A few days later, Mr. Lehman reported to senior management that the Japan sales office had

been successful in selling another $20 million in CDO securities.  Mr. Lehman wrote:  

“Great job by [Japan sales] (again) on our CDO^2 axes.  Tonight we will trade $20mm Point
Pleasant A1s @90.7 to Tokyo Star Bank .... We hope to trade another $20mm of these bonds
next week w/ this account.”

Mr. Lehman sent an email to the head of the Japan sales office letting him know that Goldman’s
senior management was aware of the sales effort:  “Montag ve[r]y involved in this  fyi.”  The Japan
sales manager responded:  “Yes – he made that clear when he spent almost 20 minutes on the desk
with me in TKO [Tokyo] last week going through every potential lead.”
Japan sales manager sent out a new email urging the trading team to bring in another $20 million
from Tokyo Star Bank and promising them additional sales incentives:

$20/bond for AAA’s on our axes that are not lower mezz AAA).  We look forward to
additional trades from Tokyo Star Bank on our CDO axes.”2119

During June and July, additional sales took place in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia.

2120

 

Goldman also made sales to customers in Europe and the Middle East.

2121

 

Despite the sales in June and July, Goldman continued to have a significant inventory of

2122

unsold CDO securities.  On August 15, 2007, Mr. Mullen even made a casual reference to “our cdo
business which remains unsaleable.”
  If Goldman’s CDOs remained unsaleable, however, it was
not for lack of trying.  In August and September 2007, Goldman switched from its targeted
customer approach to issuing broad directives to its entire sales force in the United States and
abroad urging them to concentrate on its CDO securities.  On August 17, 2007, for example, the
SPG Trading Desk issued a new directive to certain salespersons asking them to place a priority on
selling interests in two Timberwolf super senior tranches.
  These tranches were first in line to
receive payments within the CDO and so had the lowest risk.  Super senior CDO positions were
often sold through CDS contracts, sometimes called super senior swaps, in which the customer took
the long side and the CDO originator took the short side, and that’s what Goldman wanted the sales
force to market.  But the following week, on August 23, 2007, Goldman sent a new directive to the
sales force urging them to find customers willing to take the short side of the super senior tranches,
so the Mortgage Department could take the long side and cover some of its shorts.
  When asked
his opinion of the directive, the head of Japan sales office expressed skepticism about sales to Asian
customers:

Mr. Sparks emailed the syndicate desk about the “Refresh of Axe Priorities”:  “Want to get you to

2128

Goldman has at times suggested that many of its CDO sales were not the result of

affirmative client solicitations and recommendations made by the firm, but were in response to
client requests–generally known as “reverse inquiries.”  In a letter to the Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission, for example, Goldman’s General Counsel, Gregory Palm, made the following
statement about Goldman’s role as an underwriter of synthetic CDOs:

“Goldman Sachs’ CDOs containing primarily residential mortgage-related synthetic assets
were initially created in response to the request of a sophisticated institutional investor that
approached the firm specifically seeking that particular exposure.  Reverse inquiries from
clients were a common feature of this market. ...  These transactions often are initiated by
our clients, and when proposed by us are often in response to previously expressed

Trading Desk that Goldman was “prohibited from offering cdo paper to all pw [private wealth] clients, even

investment interests of the client.  We are responding to our clients’ desires either to
establish, or to increase or decrease, their exposure to a position based on their own
investment views.”2130

Mr. Palm’s characterization of Goldman as playing only a passive, responsive role is at odds with
the firm’s documented and concerted efforts to market its CDO securities in the face of investor
disinterest and falling values.  Throughout 2007, Goldman issued directives to its sales force to sell
specific CDO securities on a “first priority” basis.  It expanded its selling efforts to “nontraditional
buyers” as well as to banks, hedge funds, and other clients in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.  It
offered its sales force substantial incentives, such as “ginormous” sales credits, to push the sales to
clients.
  Under its CDO Gameplan, Goldman “targeted” four primary and 35 secondary clients
for CDO sales, and celebrated selling CDO securities to several of them.  The weight of this
evidence demonstrates that Goldman was soliciting sales rather than responding solely to client
inquiries.

2131

CC.  CDO Marks

One issue that gained intensity as the mortgage market continued its decline was Goldman’s

practice of selling CDO securities to customers at one price only to mark down the value
substantially within days or weeks of the sale, where Goldman had an ongoing client relationship.

Goldman used a mark-to-market process to manage its risk, which required valuing its

holdings on a daily basis to reflect their current market value.
related assets were marked on a monthly rather than daily basis, including many of its CDO
securities.
  Nonetheless, Goldman appears to have been more active in re-marking the value of
its mortgage related assets than other Wall Street firms and to have used lower marks than many of
its competitors.
  Goldman also had a process for automatically marking down its internal value
of any asset held longer than a specified period of time,  in order to encourage its trading desks to
sell their aged assets.

  In practice, many of its mortgage

fund clients generally needed month-end valuations of CDOs in their portfolios to enable them to report hedge fund
Net Asset Values (NAVs) to clients.  See, e.g., 6/28/2007 email from Bear Stearns, “Missing Marks (15).xls,” GS

During 2007, Goldman’s markdowns of the value of its CDO securities became a source of

lower values were assigned to Goldman’s CDO securities.  Some had purchased their CDO
securities through “repo” financing arrangements with Goldman; under those arrangements, a
decline in the value of the CDO securities being financed required the client to post more cash
margin with Goldman.  In a few other instances, clients had invested in CDO securities through a
CDS contract with Goldman.  If the CDO securities declined in value, the CDS contracts required
those clients to post more cash collateral with Goldman.  In other cases, clients did not have to post
additional cash collateral, they simply incurred losses from the lower values.

2137

 

Lower marks also had significance for Goldman internally, since a CDO security with a

marked down value might reduce the firm’s profits and reduce its long position.  Alternatively, if
Goldman held the short side of an investment, a lower mark might increase the firm’s profits,
increase the value of its short position, and bring in more cash from the long parties.  When the firm
held a proprietary position in opposition to the position held by a client, the fact that Goldman was
marking the value of its own position created a conflict of interest, since Goldman would benefit as
the client lost money.

  Mr. Broderick explained in his interview with the Subcommittee that because of the volatility in the subprime

2136
market, Goldman had an unusually large number of disputes with customers over marks or collateral valuation
during 2007.  Subcommittee interview of Craig Broderick (4/9/2010).  See also 8/2/2007 email from Stacy Bash-
Polley, “Marks Summary,” GS MBS-E-013349723 (transmitting complaints from eight clients that Goldman’s marks
were far lower than those of other dealers); 2/12/2007 email from Daniel Sparks, “Post  today,” GS MBS-E-
009763506 (New Century “claim[s] we are the only ones being harsh.  C-Bass claims we are the only one margin
calling.”); 8/10/2007 Goldman memorandum, “Summary of German Bank US Sub Prime Exposure,” GS
MBS-E-009994305.  This memorandum was generated by Goldman’s European Investment Banking Division, FICC
Sales and Credit.  It highlighted losses incurred by many German banks due to markdowns in the value of U.S.
subprime assets, necessitating several European Central Bank bailouts.  The memorandum stated:  “We understand
from clients that valuation marks provided by Goldman Sachs on ABS are substantially lower than the competition’s
valuations.  As a result, clients are irritated by the valuation difference.”

Goldman’s dispute with AIG FP is another example.  The two companies disagreed over both the marks and

the amount of collateral and margin that AIG had to post with Goldman in connection with various mortgage
products.  At one point in the dispute, Co-President Jon Winkelried wrote to his colleagues:  “[O]ne thing we’re not
going to do is compromise on what we think the right marks are and our margin process.”  8/2/2007 email from Jon
Winkelried, “Aig collateral call,” GS MBS-E-010055302.  Goldman’s dispute with AIG continued for over a year
until the Federal Reserve, through the Maiden Lane III transaction, ultimately ensured that Goldman and its
customers received 100 cents on the dollar on the bulk of their disputed claims against AIG.  Subcommittee
interview of David Viniar (4/13/2010).  Goldman later told regulators that it had more collateral disputes than
anticipated during the financial crisis.  11/13/2007 Goldman email, GS MBS-E-010023525 (attachment, 11/14/2007
“Tri-Lateral Combined Comments,” GS MBS-E-010135693-715 at 695).   According to Goldman documents, as late
as October 30, 2007, its Mortgage Department generated approximately 66% of all derivative collateral disputes by
Goldman customers.  10/30/2007 Goldman presentation, “Derivative Collateral Dispute Summary,” GS MBS-E-

Gameplan Markdowns.  When, on May 11, 2007, Goldman executives and the Mortgage

Department decided to embark upon a CDO valuation project, Goldman’s Chief Risk Officer, Craig
Broderick, sent an email to his team to discuss the consequences of lower CDO values for
Goldman’s clients.  He wrote: 

“Sparks and the Mtg [Mortgage] group are in the process of considering making significant
downward adjustment to the marks on their mortgage portfolios esp[ecially] CDOs and
CDO squared.  This will potentially have a big P&L [profit and loss] impact on us, but also
on our clients due to the marks and associated margin calls on repos, derivatives and other
products.  We need to survey our clients and take a shot at determining the most vulnerable
clients, knock on implications, etc.”2138

Mr. Broderick called for a client survey to identify which clients were “most vulnerable” to
financial difficulty if Goldman’s CDO securities were marked down in value, and they either
incurred losses or were required to post more cash margin or collateral.  He also wrote:  “This is
getting lots of 30th floor attention right now.”2139

Some Goldman managing directors also raised the issue of selling CDO securities to clients

at a price that would be marked down almost immediately.  In a May 11 email to colleagues, for
example, Goldman senior executive, Harvey Schwartz, wrote:  “[D]on’t think we can trade this with
our clients andf [sic] then mark them down dramatically the next day.”
exchange of emails with Mr. Schwartz, Mr. Montag, and Mr. Sparks, Don Mullen acknowledged
Mr. Schwartz’s concern “about the representations we may be making to clients as well as how we
will price assets once we sell them to clients.”
  The Goldman executives also agreed, however,
not to “slow or delay” efforts to sell the CDO securities, if the sales force received “strong bids.”

  Later that day, in an

2141

2140

2142

 

The May 2007 CDO valuation project resulted in lower values for many of Goldman’s CDO

assets.  While those internal markdowns were taken at month’s end, around May 25, 2007,
Goldman continued to price the CDO securities it was selling at much higher levels, creating the
potential for a rapid markdown after an asset was sold.2143

financial distress.  The Mortgage Department immediately initiated an effort to build a new, large
short position to take advantage of the expected drop in the value of subprime mortgage assets.
2144
Within two weeks, Goldman had amassed a large number of CDS contracts shorting a variety of
subprime mortgage assets.  By June 22, 2007, Goldman’s short position reached its peak size of
approximately $13.9 billion.

2145

 

  

The Bear Stearns hedge funds failed in mid-June, subprime assets plummeted in value, and
Goldman established its big short by the end of the month.  After its new net short was in place, the
Mortgage Department implemented a series of large markdowns in the value of its RMBS and CDO
assets.  The markdowns had the dual effect of increasing the value of Goldman’s net short position,
while reducing the value of many of its customers’ holdings.  Due to their financing arrangements
or CDS contracts, the lower values meant that some of the affected clients also had to post more
margin or cash collateral with the firm.  Goldman issued broad and deep markdowns of its clients’
positions at month’s end in June, July and August 2007, as well as on intermittent dates in response
to mass ratings downgrades of specific RMBS securities in July and August or to individual
customer credit issues. 

One of the markdowns took effect on July 25, 2007,

with clients that had the weakest credit, and might have fewer resources to pay the amounts owed to
Goldman as a result of the downward marks.  The same markdowns causing losses for those clients
were simultaneously increasing the profitability of Goldman’s net short. 

Two weeks later, the Mortgage Department implemented another large markdown, this time

related to Goldman’s Abacus CDOs.  This markdown took place on August 16, 2007, after the

One Goldman salesperson expressed remorse over the impact on their customers of CDO

sales followed by large markdowns within days or weeks of the client’s purchase:

 “Real bad feeling across European sales about some of the trades we did with clients.  The
damage this has done to our franchise is significant.  Aggregate loss for our clients on just ...
5 trades alone is 1bln+.”

2158

  

At the same time, the salesperson thought the sales force deserved a bigger share of the profits
generated for the firm:

“In addition team feels that recognition (sales credits and otherwise) they received for
getting this business done was not consistent with the money it ended up making/saving the
firm.”2159

A Goldman salesperson in Taiwan sought help in explaining Goldman’s markdowns to a

bank whose CDO investment had been marked down from about 97 to about 45 cents on the dollar
in a matter of weeks: 

“[B]ank just bought the altius deal from gs [Goldman Sachs] 5 weeks ago and the mtm

Even before this email, Goldman’s sales force had been vocal in its criticism of Goldman’s
low marks which were making their sales job more difficult.  On June 21, 2007, Mr. Sparks stated
in an email:  “sales is making significant noise about gs notable conservatism in marking and

managing director responded:  “Would have tho[ugh]t that bsam event [failure of Bear Stearns

responded:  “Our marking policy is a market price (bid and/or offer) – We do not have a written

but in some cases, Goldman purchased CDS protection or equity puts on its clients’ stock,
essentially betting that the stock price would fall or the company would lose value.  For example,
after ACA Financial Guaranty Corp., the parent company of ACA Management which acted as the
collateral manager of Abacus 2007-AC1, purchased Abacus securities, Goldman purchased the
short side of a CDS contract that referenced ACA Financial Guaranty.  ACA Financial Guaranty
encountered extreme financial distress in late 2007.2173

At the Subcommittee hearing, Goldman executives were asked about the four Goldman-

2174

AC1.
  Senator John Tester noted Mr. Birnbaum’s testimony that, in 2007, Goldman could “see
some things happening,”
Senator Tester asked Mr. Sparks, in light of those developments, “how [he] got comfortable with
sales,” and how he “in good faith” sold the CDO securities to Goldman’s customers – how he could

Senator Tester:  Perform in what way?

Mr. Sparks:  To not be downgraded–

Senator Tester:   Perform to go to junk, so that the shorts made out?

Mr. Sparks:  To not be downgraded to junk in that short a time frame.  In fact, to not be

While Mr. Sparks testified that, in 2007, the Mortgage Department expected its CDOs “to
perform,” a contemporaneous draft presentation that he helped prepare in May 2007 stated that the
“desk expects [the CDOs] to underperform.”
  Many other emails provide his negative views of
the CDO market at the time, including emails in which Mr. Sparks described the subprime market
as “bad and getting worse,”
everything,”
2182
“bad news everywhere,” and “the business is totally dead.”

Mr. Sparks also testified that the Mortgage Department did not expect the Goldman-issued
CDOs to be downgraded, but all were within a year of issuance.  In April 2007, for example, six of
the 20 RMBS deals that comprised the ABX Index were downgraded,
 and the Hudson CDO that
referenced them followed soon after.  Many of the RMBS securities referenced in the other three
CDOs were downgraded within three months of the issuance of the last CDO in April 2007, making
the downgrade of the CDOs themselves all but inevitable.

(b)  Goldman’s Conflicts of Interest 

In late 2006 and 2007, Goldman’s securitization business was marked, not just by its hard
sell tactics, but also by multiple conflicts of interest in which Goldman’s financial interests were
opposed to those of its clients.  The following examples illustrate the problem. 

(i)  Conflicts of Interest Involving RMBS Securities

In 2006 and 2007, Goldman originated 27 CDO and 93 RMBS securitizations.  Beginning in

December 2006, Goldman originated and aggressively marketed some of these securities at the
same time that subprime and other high risk loans were defaulting at alarming rates, the subprime
and CDO markets were deteriorating, and Goldman was shorting subprime mortgage assets.  At
times, Goldman originated and sold RMBS securities that it knew had poor quality loans that were
likely to incur abnormally high rates of default.  At times, Goldman went further and sold RMBS
securities to customers at the same time it was shorting the securities and essentially betting that
they would lose value.  Two examples illustrate how Goldman constructed and sold poor quality
RMBS securities and profited from the decline of the very securities it had sold to its clients. 

Long Beach RMBS.  The first example involves Washington Mutual Bank (WaMu) and its

subprime lender, Long Beach Mortgage Corporation.  WaMu, Long Beach, and Goldman had
collaborated on at least $14 billion in loan sales and securitizations.
  In February 2006, Long
Beach had a $2 billion warehouse account with Goldman, which was the largest of Goldman’s
warehouse accounts at that time.

2189

2190

  

Long Beach was known within the industry for originating some of the worst performing

subprime mortgages in the country.  As explained in Chapter III, in 2005, a surge of early payment
defaults in its subprime loans required Long Beach to repurchase over $837 million of
nonperforming loans from investors, as well as book a $107 million loss.
affected its loans in 2006 and 2007.  WaMu reviews and audits of Long Beach, as well as
examinations by the Office of Thrift Supervision, repeatedly identified serious deficiencies in its
lending practices, including lax underwriting standards, unacceptable loan error and exception rates,
weak risk management, appraisal problems, inadequate oversight of third party brokers selling loans
to the firm, and loan fraud.  While these reviews were not available to the public, the performance
of Long Beach paper was.  Long Beach securitizations had among the worst credit losses in the

industry from 1999-2003; in 2005 and 2006, Long Beach securities were among the worst
performing in the market.

2192

 

Nevertheless, in May 2006, Goldman acted as co-lead underwriter with WaMu to securitize

about $532 million in subprime second lien mortgages originated by Long Beach.  Long Beach
Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-A (LBMLT 2006-A) issued approximately $495 million in RMBS
securities backed by those Long Beach mortgages.  The top three tranches, representing about 66%
of the principal loan balance, received AAA ratings from S&P, even though the pool contained
subprime second lien mortgages – loans which could recover funds in the event of a default only
after the primary loan was repaid — and even though the loans were issued by one of the nation’s
worst performing mortgage lenders.  Yet Goldman was able to use two-thirds of that extremely
risky debt to issue AAA rated securities which Goldman then sold to its customers. 

In less than a year, the Long Beach loans began incurring delinquencies.  In February 2007, a

Goldman analyst reported internally that all of Goldman’s 2006 subprime second lien RMBS
securities were deteriorating in performance, but “deals backed by Fremont and Long Beach
collateral have generally underperformed the most.”
  The analyst predicted “lifetime losses in the
teens, and over 20% in some deals.”  By May 2007, the cumulative net loss on the LBMLT 2006-A
mortgage pool had climbed to over 12%, eliminating most of the financial cushion protecting the
investment grade securities from loss.  That month, S&P downgraded six out of the seven credit
ratings for the mezzanine tranches of the securitization.  The Long Beach securities plummeted in
value.  

2193

Goldman held some of the unsold Long Beach mezzanine securities on its books, meaning

LBMLT 2006-A securities that carried credit ratings of BBB or BBB-.  Goldman had also
purchased the short side of a CDS contract that would pay off if those same securities lost value. 
On May 17, 2007, Deeb Salem, a trader on the Mortgage Department’s ABS Desk, learned of
additional losses in the Long Beach securitization and wrote to his supervisor Michael Swenson
with the news: 

“[B]ad news …  [The loss] wipes out the m6s [mezzanine tranches] and makes a wipeout of
the m5 imminent.  … [C]osts us about 2.5 [million dollars].  … [G]ood news ... [W]e own
10 [million dollars] protection at the m6 … [W]e make $5 [million].”

2194

  

In other words, Goldman lost $2.5 million from the unsold Long Beach securities still on its books,
but gained $5 million from the CDS contract shorting those same securities.  Overall, Goldman
profited from the decline of the same type of securities it had earlier sold to its customers.

Even before the actions taken by regulators in March 2007, Goldman was aware of the poor
quality of at least some of Fremont’s loans.  In a November 2006 exchange of emails, for example,
two Goldman sales representatives were discussing trying to sell Fremont RMBS securities to a
client.  One salesperson forwarded to the other the client’s explanation of why it did not want to buy
the securities and its low opinion of Fremont’s loan pools:  “Fremont refused to make any forward
looking statements so we really got nothing from them on the crap pools that are out there now.”
2198
In March 2007, Goldman initiated a detailed review of its Fremont loan inventory to identify
deficient loans that it could return to the lender for a refund.  Mr. Gasvoda placed a priority on
reviewing Fremont loans “since they still have cash but may not for long.”

S&P rated the securities, even though analysts at both rating firms expressed concern about the
quality of Fremont loans.  At S&P, for example, in a January 2007 email to his supervisor, a credit
ratings analyst wrote:  “I have a Goldman deal with subprime Fremont collateral.  Since Fremont
collateral has been performing not so good, is there anything special I should be aware of?”

  Seven months later, by October 2007, the ratings downgrades had begun; by August

In both examples involving Long Beach and Fremont RMBS securities, Goldman obtained
CDS protection and essentially bet against the very securities it was selling to clients.  In each case,
Goldman profited from the fall in value of the same securities it sold to its clients and which caused
those clients to suffer substantial losses.

(ii)  Conflicts of Interest Involving Sales of CDO Securities

As with some of its RMBS securities, Goldman at times originated CDO securities using
assets that it believed were of poor quality and would lose value, and sold the securities at higher
prices than it believed they were worth.
  In addition, Goldman took steps that created multiple
conflicts of interest with the clients to whom it sold the CDO securities, and placed its financial
interests ahead of those of its clients.  Four examples involving the Hudson 1, Anderson,
Timberwolf, and Abacus 2007-AC1 CDOs illustrate the problems.  Those problems include
troubling and sometimes abusive practices related to how Goldman designed the CDOs and selected

examined seven CDOs issued by Goldman, and of those, 57% of the CDOs’ assets were sourced from Goldman,
including over $3 billion in synthetic assets in which Goldman was the short party, and therefore stood to profit from
a decline in the value of the underlying assets.

was the second in a series of three “Hudson” branded CDOs, which according to Goldman
marketing materials were intended “to create a consistent, programmatic approach to invest in
attractive relative value opportunities in the RMBS and structured product market.”
  One key
feature of the three Hudson CDOs was that Goldman itself, without any third party participation,
selected the CDO’s assets, which were supposed to remain with the CDO until they reached
maturity or were deemed “credit risk assets,” at which point Goldman, acting as the liquidation
agent for the CDO, was responsible for selling them.
  In each of the Hudson CDOs, Goldman
played multiple roles in its formation and administration, including selecting assets and serving as
the underwriter, initial purchaser of the CDO securities, collateral put provider,
counterparty, and credit protection buyer.
  In Hudson 1, Goldman took 100% of the short side of
the CDO, and when the Hudson 1 securities declined in value, Goldman made a $1.35 billion profit
at the expense of the clients to whom it had sold the Hudson 1 securities.

of five separate indices, each of which tracks a different subset of the RMBS basket, divided according to credit
ratings.  The indices that track the mezzanine RMBS securities, for example, track the 20 RMBS securities that carry
BBB and BBB- credit ratings.  In ABX assets, investors enter into CDS contracts in which one party takes the long
side, essentially betting that the ABX indices tracking the mezzanine RMBS securities will increase in value, while
the other party takes the short side, essentially betting that the indices will fall in value.  Prior to establishing the
Hudson CDO, Goldman had taken the long side in a number of CDS contracts linked to the ABX indices tracking
mezzanine RMBS securities.

Transferring Risk.  Hudson 1 was conceived and designed by Goldman to transfer the risk

associated with a large collection of ABX assets in its inventory, in which Goldman held the long
side of CDS contracts referencing mezzanine subprime RMBS securities that were tracked by the
ABX Index and that might go down in value.  The objective of the CDO was to transfer the risk of
unwanted financial assets off of Goldman’s books.  In response to questions from the
Subcommittee, Goldman explained that Hudson 1 was “initiated by the firm as the most efficient
method to reduce long ABX exposures.”
  Contemporaneous notes from Goldman’s Firmwide
Risk Committee meetings also stated that Hudson 1 was an “exit for our long ABX risk.”
Goldman records show that the firm used Hudson 1 to short $1.2 billion worth of the ABX assets in
the firm’s inventory as well as $800 million in single name CDS contracts referencing subprime
RMBS securities carrying mostly BBB or BBB- credit ratings.  Hudson 1 was one of several
methods Goldman used to transfer its risk associated with its subprime mortgage holdings during
the fall of 2006.2218

directed the Mortgage Department’s ABS Desk to sell off its ABX holdings.

assets, which were dropping in value, were losing millions of dollars for the firm.

found a “structured place to go with the risk.”2223
 

Later that day, Mr. Sparks approached Peter Ostrem, who headed the desk that originated
CDOs for Goldman, and asked “if there was something [the CDO Desk] could do with ABX.”
 
2224
Mr. Ostrem spoke with Darryl Herrick, who worked for him on the CDO Desk and who eventually
became the Hudson 1 deal captain, about crafting a CDO to reduce the firm’s ABX risk.  The two
brainstormed a structure that became the foundation of Hudson 1.

2225

  

That same evening, September 19, 2006, Mr. Swenson scheduled a meeting with several
traders on the ABS Desk he oversaw, Joshua Birnbaum from the ABX Desk, and Mr. Ostrem and
other personnel from the CDO Origination Desk to discuss “ABX and Single-Name
Opportunities.”
announcing “Hudson Mezz - new”: 

   After the meeting, around 8:00 p.m., Mr. Ostrem sent his CDO team an email

2226

“We have been asked to do a CDO of $2bln [billion] for the ABS desk. Approx. $1.2bln
will be CDS off single-names referenced from the AB[X] index 06-1 and 06-2.  This is a
trade we need to execute for the desk over the next 4-6 weeks and involves selling half the
equity (at least 30mm to sell) and the seniors and the mezz (at least half of the BBBs to get
true sale).  I would like everyone to work together on this one.  We expect to charge ongoing
10bp [basis point] liquidation agent fees and 1-1.5pts upfront.  ...  Obviously important to
overall SP [Structured Product] floor and Sobel and Sparks are focused on this
happening.”2227

Also that evening, Mr. Swenson emailed Mr. Sobel to inform him they were “proceeding with the
CDO solution, the CDO team has 60 single-names that they will be able to begin to build a deal
around.”

2228

  

The next day, Mr. Sobel reported to senior executives at Goldman’s Firmwide Risk

Committee that the CDO Desk was working on the first ever ABX CDO, which would function as
an exit for the firm’s long ABX position.

with the Hudson 1 concept, Mr. Jha emailed Mr. Birnbaum asking about the CDO:  “Sobel this

sourced from ABX desk - this risk is already being captured in our risk number for SPG
Trading desk. ... The remaining $0.8bn will be composed of single name CDS.  Since we do
not have any pre-existing long (credit), we will be going short after we price this CDO and
therefore will have a risk mitigating impact on our risk.  Please correct me if I am getting
this wrong.”

Designing Hudson 1.  At the time Hudson 1 was conceived, no other investment bank had

issued a CDO in which the majority of assets referenced ABX assets.
credit rating agencies refused to rate any CDO with more than a 5% exposure to credit default
swaps (CDS) using an ABX index as the reference obligation.
the reference obligation allowed the parties to the CDS to make a pure bet on the composite
performance of a basket of 20 RMBS securities.  Credit rating agencies were concerned that the
inclusion of ABX assets in CDOs would increase market-wide correlation and make CDO
performance more volatile.

  Prior to that, the major

  CDS that used an ABX index as

2235

2234

In order to get around that limitation and create a CDO that the credit rating agencies would
be willing to rate, Goldman took several steps.  First, it decided Hudson 1 would reference the two
ABX 06-1 indices and the two ABX 06-2 indices that referenced RMBS securities with BBB and
BBB- ratings.  Since each of those four indices tracked 20 subprime mezzanine RMBS securities,
altogether they tracked 80 RMBS securities.

  Next, Goldman created 80 single name CDS

securitizations.  Each Index also had its own subset of five indices tracking individual securities issued by those 20
securitizations, divided by credit rating.  For example, one of the RMBS securitizations tracked by the ABX 06-2
Index was called CWL 2006-8.  One of the sub-indices within the ABX 06-2 Index tracked BBB rated securities that

the short position in the 80 single name CDS contracts, the ABS Desk essentially offset its long
position in the corresponding ABX contracts.  Next, the CDO Origination Desk entered into a CDS
contract with Hudson 1, taking the short side while the Hudson CDO assumed the long side of the
80 single name CDS contracts.  The end result was that Hudson 1 took the long side and assumed
the risk associated with the long position for $1.2 billion worth of CDS single name contracts
referencing the RMBS securities comprising the ABX 06-1 and 06-2 BBB and BBB- indices.
2239
transferring the long CDS position to Hudson, Goldman effectively transferred the risk associated
with its ABX long assets to any investors who bought the Hudson securities.

price of CDS contracts that used an ABX index as the reference obligation was lower than the price
of CDS contracts that used an individual RMBS security as its reference obligation.  Because
Goldman exercised complete control over the CDO and created CDS contracts referencing assets
from its own inventory, Goldman also exercised complete control over the pricing of those
contracts.  When Goldman set up the 80 single name CDS contracts, and sold the long side of those
contracts to Hudson 1, Goldman decided internally what it would charge the CDO to acquire the
long side of those contracts.  Goldman decided to price the contracts, not according to the cost of a
single name CDS contract on the market, but instead according to the cost of a CDS contract for the
long side of the relevant ABX index that day.
  By using this pricing method, Goldman enabled
Hudson to purchase the single name CDS contracts at the lower ABX prices, which meant it could

Another of the five indices tracked the securities carrying a BBB- rating, including the M9 tranche of CWL 2006-8

clients wanted to sell the ABX in order to express a negative view on the U.S. residential housing market.  As a
result of these trades, we took on long positions.  In order to hedge those positions, we began to increase our short
position in single-names.  By November 2006, volatility in the ABX increased, pushing prices down.  Because our
positions in single names did not match identically the basket of securities that comprised the ABX, the positions
moved at different rates and even different directions, resulting in losses for the ABS desk.”  Prepared statement of

The pricing differential also benefitted Goldman’s ABS Desk in two ways.  First, it created a

modest incentive for investors to buy Hudson securities and take the long position needed to offset
Goldman’s ABX risk.  Second, it left Goldman with a short position in the form of CDS single
name contracts, which Goldman expected to become more valuable than a short position in CDS
contracts that referenced ABX indices.  The ABS Desk kept both its long ABX positions and its
short single name CDS positions in the same dedicated account.  Over time, the short position in
single name CDS did gain in value and boosted the overall value of the portfolio of assets held by
the ABS Desk by more than $1 million, producing additional profits for Goldman.

2243

 

 In addition to the $1.2 billion in single name CDS contracts to offset Goldman’s ABX risk,
Mr. Herrick from the CDO Origination Desk and Deeb Salem from the ABS Desk worked together
to select $800 million in additional single name CDS contracts to include in the Hudson CDO.
 
2244
Mr. Herrick told the Subcommittee that he gave Mr. Salem a specific set of criteria for selecting
these CDS contracts, including a list of RMBS names that he wanted to be included, a list of RMBS
names that he did not want to be included, and an acceptable price range for each CDS contract. 
Since Goldman planned to take 100% of the short side of Hudson 1, these lists were presumably
used to identify RMBS contracts that Goldman expected to offset Goldman’s long positions.  Mr.
Herrick told the Subcommittee that Mr. Salem responded with an initial list of 60 possible RMBS
reference obligations, 52 of which were ultimately included in Hudson 1.2245

Marketing Hudson.  After establishing its basic characteristics and selecting the CDS

assets to be included in Hudson 1, Goldman began to look for investors.  A key development took
place early on, when near the end of September 2006, Morgan Stanley’s proprietary trading desk
committed to entering into a CDS agreement with Goldman referencing the “super senior” portion
of Hudson 1, meaning the CDO’s lowest risk tranche that would be the first to receive payments to
the CDO.
  Morgan Stanley agreed to take the long side of a CDS that represented $1.2 billion of
the $2 billion CDO, while Goldman took the short side.
Hudson 1, Morgan Stanley was permitted to review the $800 million in single name CDS contracts
to be included in the CDO and, in fact, vetoed the proposed inclusion of certain CDS contracts
referencing commercial mortgage backed securities.2250

the CDO Origination Desk including Benjamin Case and Matthew Bieber.
  The executive
summary of the marketing booklet described Goldman’s Hudson CDO program generally and
Hudson 1 in particular: 

2253

“Goldman Sachs developed the Hudson CDO program in 2006 to create a consistent,
programmatic approach to invest in attractive relative value opportunities in the RMBS and
structured product market[.]

-We successfully launched Hudson High Grade in September. This is a continuation of the
program using mezzanine Baa2/Baa3 quality RMBS[.]

Hudson CDOs are non-managed and static in nature and provide term non-recourse funding
where Goldman Sachs acts as Liquidation Agent on an ongoing basis.  The
Liquidation Agent will be responsible for efficiently selling credit risk assets  ...

Goldman Sachs has aligned incentives with the Hudson program by investing in a portion of
equity and playing the ongoing role of Liquidation Agent.”

2254

 

The marketing booklet also described the Hudson 1 assets, and the selection process for

those assets:

“The portfolio composition of Hudson Mezzanine Funding 2006-1 will consist of 100%
CDS on RMBS. 

- 60% of the RMBS will be single name CDS on all 40 obligors in ABX 2006-1 and ABX
2006-2

- 40% of the RMBS will consist of single name CDS on 2005 and 2006 vintage RMBS ...

Goldman Sachs’ portfolio selection process: 

- Assets sourced from the Street.  Hudson Mezzanine Funding is not a Balance Sheet CDO
- Goldman Sachs CDO desk pre-screens and evaluates assets for portfolio suitability
- Goldman Sachs CDO desk reviews individual assets in conjunction with respective
mortgage trading desks (Subprime, Midprime, Prime, etc.) and makes decision to add or
decline[.]”2255

The marketing booklet statement that “Goldman Sachs had aligned incentives with the

Hudson program by investing in a portion of equity,” was misleading.  Goldman did, in fact,
purchase approximately $6 million in Hudson equity.
investment was outweighed many times over by Goldman’s $2 billion short position, which made
Goldman’s interest adverse to, rather than aligned with, the Hudson investors.  Neither the
marketing booklet nor other offering materials disclosed to investors the size or nature of
Goldman’s short position in Hudson 1.

  However, that $6 million equity

The marketing booklet also stated that Hudson’s assets were “sourced from the Street,” and

  
that it was “not a Balance Sheet CDO,” even though all of the CDS contracts had been produced
and priced internally by Goldman and $1.2 billion of the contracts offset Goldman ABX holdings. 
The plain meaning of the phrase, “sourced from the Street,” is that the Hudson 1 assets were
purchased from several broker-dealers on Wall Street.
who sold Hudson 1 securities to investors told the Subcommittee that he thought “sourced from the
Street” referred to assets being acquired from a variety of different broker-dealers at the best prices,
and was surprised to learn that all of the Hudson assets had been provided by Goldman’s ABS
Desk.
  A Hudson 1 investor told the Subcommittee that it had also interpreted the phrase
“sourced from the Street” to mean assets acquired from a variety of different broker-dealers.

The Subcommittee asked several Goldman traders involved in Hudson 1 to explain their
understanding of the phrase, and received inconsistent answers.  Darryl Herrick, who drafted the
Hudson marketing booklet, stated that “sourced from the Street” meant the assets were “sourced
from a street dealer at street prices.”  His supervisor, CDO Managing Director Peter Ostrem, stated
that “sourced from the Street” referred to the fact the underlying RMBS securities were not
originated or underwritten by Goldman.
40% of the assets in Hudson 1, described “the Street” as simply “short hand for all broker-
dealers.”
and Matthew Bieber, who worked for Mr. Ostrem and later Mr. Lehman, claimed that it was
accurate to say the Hudson assets were “sourced from the Street,” even though all the assets were
acquired from the Goldman ABS Desk, because Goldman was part of “the Street.”

  The Subcommittee asked Mr. Ostrem whether he considered the Hudson 1 assets to be the RMBS securities or
the credit default swaps referencing those securities, and Mr. Ostrem responded that the assets in the CDO were the
RMBS securities which had been originated by a variety of financial institutions on Wall Street.  When asked why it
would be important to indicate to investors that not all the underlying RMBS securities were underwritten by
Goldman, given that this information would be clear to a professional reviewing the names of the reference assets in
Hudson 1, Mr. Ostrem replied that he didn’t know.  Subcommittee interview of Peter Ostrem (10/5/2010).

By using the phrase, “sourced from the Street,” Goldman may have misled investors into

thinking that the referenced assets had been purchased from several broker-dealers and obtained at
arms-length prices, rather than simply taken directly from Goldman’s inventory and priced by its
own personnel.  Moreover, this phrase also appears to hide the fact that Goldman had an adverse
interest to investors and was seeking to transfer unwanted risk from its own inventory to the clients
it was soliciting.  By claiming it was “not a Balance Sheet CDO,” Goldman may have misled
investors into believing that Goldman had little interest in the performance of the referenced assets
in Hudson, rather than having selected the assets to offset risks on its own books.  

In addition to the Hudson marketing booklet, in December 2006, Goldman issued an

Offering Circular which it distributed to potential investors.
  The Offering Circular contained the
statement that no independent third party had reviewed the prices at which the CDS contracts were
sold to Hudson 1.
participated in any aspect of the CDS contracts – all of the CDS contracts had been produced,
signed, and priced internally by two Goldman trading desks which exercised complete control over
the Hudson CDO.  

  In addition to lacking third party verification, no external counterparty had

Birnbaum, raising questions about how they could explain some of the pricing decisions. 
Mr. Swenson wrote that he was:  “concerned that the levels we put on the abx cdo for single-a and
triple-bs do not compare favorably with the single-a off of a abx 1 + abx 2 trade,” telling Mr.
Birnbaum “[w]e need a goo[d] story as to why we think the risk is different.”
  The prices that
Goldman established for the CDS contracts that Hudson “bought” affected the value of the CDO
and the Hudson 1 securities Goldman sold to investors, but the Offering Circular failed to disclose
the extent to which Goldman had single-handedly controlled the pricing of 100% of the CDO’s
assets. 

2266

Perhaps the most serious omission from the marketing booklet and other offering materials

was Goldman’s failure to disclose the fact that it would be the sole short party in the entire $2
billion CDO.  The Goldman materials told investors that an affiliate, Goldman Sachs International
(GSI), would be the “credit protection buyer” or initial short party for the Hudson 1 CDO.

plate language suggesting that would be the role played by GSI in the Hudson transaction. 
Goldman never disclosed that it had provided all of Hudson’s assets internally, GSI was not acting
as an intermediary, and GSI would not be passing on any portion of the short interest in Hudson to
any other party, but would be keeping 100% of the short position.  The Hudson disclosures failed to
state that, rather than serving as an intermediary, Goldman was making a proprietary investment in
the CDO which placed it in a direct, adverse position to the investors to whom it was selling the
Hudson securities. 

The Offering Circular contained a section entitled, “Certain Conflicts of Interest,” which
included a subsection entitled, “The Credit Protection Buyer and Senior Swap Counterparty,” in
which Goldman could have disclosed its short position.  Rather than disclose that short position,
however, Goldman stated in part:

“GSI and/or any of its affiliates may invest and/or deal, for their own respective accounts for
which they have investment discretion, in securities or in other interests in the Reference
Entities, in obligations of the Reference Entities or in the obligors in respect of any
Reference Obligations or Collateral Securities (the “Investments”), or in credit default swaps
(whether as protection buyer or seller), total return swaps or other instruments enabling
credit and/or other risks to be traded that are linked to one or more Investments.”

2269

  

This disclosure indicates that GSI or an affiliate “may invest and/or deal” in securities or other
“interests” in the assets underlying the Hudson CDO, and “may invest and/or deal” in CDS
contracts that are “linked to” the Hudson “investments.”  The Offering Circular, however,
misrepresented Goldman’s investment plans.  At the time it was created in December 2006,
Goldman had already determined to keep 100% of the short side of the Hudson CDO and act as the
sole counterparty to the investors buying Hudson securities, thereby acquiring a $2 billion financial
interest that was directly adverse to theirs.  

Tracking Hudson.  Once it constructed the Hudson CDO, Goldman personnel were

focused on completing and selling the Hudson 1 securities as quickly as possible.  At least one other
CDO was pushed back to facilitate the execution of Hudson 1.

difficulty selling Hudson securities to investors due to its reliance on BBB and BBB- rated

Hudson securities as “junk.”
  One Goldman employee emailed the CDO team and asked:

“[D]o we have anything talking about how great the BBB sector of RMBS is at this point in

On October 25, 2006, Mr. Sobel sent a Hudson update to COO Gary Cohn and CFO David
Viniar:  “$1.6bn of the $2bn sold, with the majority of the unsold bonds being investment grade. 
Equity more than 85% sold.”2280

The Goldman sales force sold most of the Hudson securities prior to the CDO’s closing in

December 2006, and continued its sales efforts after the closing as well.  Two months after the
closing, in February 2007, Goldman had $296 million in unsold Hudson securities, not including
the $6 million equity investment Goldman had announced in the Hudson marketing material that it
would purchase and hold.  Over the following months, Goldman sold an additional $38 million
worth of securities to investors, and received bids on several other securities but decided the bid
prices were too low and kept the securities on its books instead.
  The unsold Hudson securities
were split between the CDO Origination Desk and ABS Trading Desk.

Overall, Goldman sold Hudson securities to 25 investors.  Morgan Stanley made the largest
investment, taking $1.2 billion of the super senior portion of the CDO.  Other investors included the

was designed to offset the risk associated with the ABS Desk’s ABX assets.  See also 2/28/2007 email from David

Profiting from Hudson.  On October 30, 2006, after Hudson 1 was presented to investors

and pre-sold most of its securities, Peter Ostrem, the head of the CDO Origination Desk, sent a
celebratory email to the ABS and CDO teams with Hudson highlights.  He wrote:  “Goldman was
the sole buyer of protection on the entire $2.0 billion of assets,” meaning Goldman had kept 100%
of the short position.  By shorting Hudson, Goldman had transferred $1.2 billion worth of risky
ABX assets Goldman wanted off its books, and shorted another $800 million in RMBS securities. 
Mr. Ostrem also listed these “highlights”:

•

“P&L [Profit and Loss] booked of $8.5mm ....  Plus, ongoing P&L to GS for acting

referenced in the ABX indices declined, Goldman, as the sole short party in Hudson, collected
$1.393 billion in gains directly from the investors to whom it had sold the Hudson securities. 
Goldman’s $1.393 billion gains were, in turn, offset internally at the firm by the ABX losses
recorded on the books of its ABS Desk.  Goldman made another $304 million in gains due to its
short of the other $800 million in single name CDS contracts included in Hudson 1.

name CDS contracts reported a gain of approximately $1.2 million due to the higher value of the
single name CDS compared to the ABX CDS.

2287

 

Goldman also incurred some losses in connection with Hudson 1.  Although Goldman sold
some additional Hudson securities several months after the CDO closed, it incurred a $267 million
loss from the Hudson 1 securities that it was unable to sell at the prices it wanted and instead
retained in its inventory.  Goldman lost another $111 million from serving as the collateral put
provider for Hudson collateral securities which also lost value.
  Overall, however, Goldman
recorded a profit from Hudson 1 of more than $1.35 billion.

2288

In contrast to Goldman, Hudson 1 investors suffered substantial losses.  In March 2007, less
than three months after the issuance of the Hudson securities, when asked to analyze how a holder
of Hudson securities could hedge against a drop in their value, a Goldman trader wrote: “their
likelihood of getting principal back is almost zero.”
downgrades began.  In September 2007, Moody’s downgraded several Hudson 1 securities and
followed with additional downgrades in November 2007.  S&P began downgrades of Hudson 1 in
December 2007, and by February 2008, had downgraded even the AAA rated securities.2290

  Six months later, the credit rating

2289

Morgan Stanley, the largest Hudson investor, lost $930 million.

  As other investors
incurred increasing losses, they sold their securities back to Goldman at rock bottom prices.  In
September 2007, for example, nine months after the Hudson securities were first issued, Goldman
repurchased $10 million worth of Hudson securities from Greywolf Capital at a price of five cents
on the dollar; in October 2007, another hedge fund sold $1 million in Hudson securities back to
Goldman at a price of 2.5 cents on the dollar.
   In November 2008, Hudson 1 was completely
liquidated by Goldman.  Today, Hudson securities are worthless.

2292

2291

Analysis.  Goldman constructed Hudson 1 as a way to transfer its ABX risk to the investors
who bought Hudson securities.  When marketing the Hudson securities, Goldman misled investors
by claiming its investment interests were aligned with theirs, when it was the sole short party and
was betting against the very securities it was recommending.  Goldman also implied that Hudson’s
assets had been purchased from outside sources, and failed to state that it had selected the majority
of the assets from its own inventory and priced the assets without any third party participation.  By
holding 100% of the short position at the same time it solicited clients to buy the Hudson securities,
Goldman created a conflict of interest with its clients, concealed the conflict from them, and
profited at their expense.

BB.  Anderson Mezzanine Funding 2007-1 

532

In the summer of 2006, Goldman began work on Anderson Mezzanine Funding 2007-1

(Anderson), a synthetic CDO whose assets were single name CDS contracts referencing subprime
RMBS securities with mezzanine credit ratings.
partnered with GSC Partners (GSC), a New York hedge fund.  Goldman personnel working on the
CDO included Peter Ostrem, head of the CDO Origination Desk, and Matthew Bieber, a CDO
Origination Desk employee assigned to be deal captain for the Anderson CDO.

  To execute the Anderson CDO, Goldman

Partnering on Anderson.  GSC Partners was founded by Alfred C. Eckert, III, a former

partner and former head of private equity, distressed debt investing, and corporate finance at
Goldman.
  Goldman had a longstanding relationship with GSC.  In addition to Mr. Eckert, at
least five other former Goldman Managing Directors were employed by GSC, and at least eight
other former and current Managing Directors had invested in one or more of GSC’s funds.
spring of 2006, GSC circulated information through Goldman about raising money for its Elliot
Bridge Fund, a “fixed income arb[itrage] fund focusing primarily on ABS using cash and synthetics,
long/short strategies.”
  When discussing the fund with other Goldman employees, Curtis Willing,
the Goldman sales representative responsible for covering GSC wrote:  “They are a strategic partner
with the Synthetic desk and have handed us multiple CDO/CLO mandates.”
informed of the internal conversations almost a month later, Mr. Sparks informed Mr. Willing that
it was a “[m]istake not to involve me from early on,” telling Mr. Willing, “I’ve run a bunch of traps
for [GSC] in the past.”2300

  Some documents indicate the CDO was slated to be Hudson Mezzanine 2006-2.  But in December 2006,

  “Mezzanine” CDS assets reference securities that carry a credit rating of BBB or BBB-.  Mezzanine assets are
riskier than AAA, AA, and A rated assets, but less risky than those that carry, for example, BB, B, or CCC ratings. 
2294
Goldman delayed Anderson in favor of issuing an ABX based CDO named Hudson Mezzanine 2006-2.  Several of
the documents cited in this section use the terms “Hudson” or “Hudson Mezz” when in fact they refer to Anderson. 
None of the Goldman employees interviewed by the Subcommittee could recall the reason for changing the name of
the CDO to Anderson.

be using standard language reused in many MCC Memoranda.  In an interview with the Subcommittee, Edward 
Steffelin, a Senior Trader at GSC, stated that Goldman approached GSC about partnering in the transaction, and the
memorandum language was “probably backward.”  Subcommittee interview of Edward Steffelin (12/10/2010).

Goldman offered to let GSC take a short interest in the CDO by offering to “sell protection

meaning GSC could propose assets for the CDO that GSC wanted to get rid of or short.
  GSC
responded by shorting a select group of RMBS securities to hedge its risk while those assets were in
the Anderson warehouse account.
  For instance, at one point in October 2006, GSC sought to add
$56 million in assets to the Anderson CDO, while also taking a short position on $9 million of those
assets, which it described as “GSC Hedge Amount.”

in Anderson.

Anderson’s assets were purchased from 11 different broker-dealers from September 2006 to

March 2007.  Goldman was the source of 28 of the 61 CDS contracts in Anderson, and Goldman
retained the short side.  The next largest short party was Lehman Brothers which sold six CDS
contracts to Anderson and retained the short side.  Goldman also served as the sole credit protection
buyer to the Anderson CDO, acting as the intermediary between the CDO and the various broker-
dealers selling it assets.

2311

 

By February 2007, the Anderson warehouse account contained $305 million out of the
intended $500 million worth of single name CDS, many of which referenced mortgage pools
originated by New Century, Fremont, and Countrywide, subprime lenders known within the
industry for issuing poor quality loans and RMBS securities.  Approximately 45% of the referenced
RMBS securities contained New Century mortgages.

Goldman was also aware that its longtime customer, New Century, was in financial distress. 

On February 7, 2007, New Century announced publicly it would be restating its 2006 earnings,
causing a sharp drop in the company’s share price.  On February 8, 2007, Goldman’s Chief Credit
Officer Craig Broderick sent Mr. Sparks and others a press clipping about New Century and
warned:  

“[T]his is a materially adverse development.  The issues involve inadequate [early payment
default] provisions and marks on residuals ....  [I]n a confidence sensitive industry it will be

New Century originated 48% by value of the underlying mortgages.  However, each mortgage may have a different
weight in the Anderson CDO based on the size of the reference security it is held in.  Therefore, the economic effect
of the New Century mortgages could be greater than or less than 48%.  The next largest mortgage originator by value
was Countrywide at 8%.

ugly even if all problems have been identified. ... We have a call with the company in a few
minutes (to be led by Dan Sparks).” 

2315

  

On some occasions, Mr. Sparks addressed negative news about New Century in the same
email he discussed liquidating assets in warehouse accounts for upcoming CDOs.  On March 8,
2007, for example, Mr. Sparks noted in an email to senior executives:  “New Century remains a
problem” due to loans experiencing early payment defaults, and informed them that the Mortgage
Department had “liquidated a few deals and could liquidate a couple more.”

   

2316

On February 23, 2007, Mr. Sparks sent an email to senior Goldman executives estimating
that Goldman had lost $72 million on the holdings in its CDO warehouse accounts, due to falling
prices.
  He directed Mortgage Department personnel to liquidate rather than securitize the assets
in certain warehouse accounts.  Two days later, on February 25, 2007, Mr. Sparks informed senior
executives of the possibility of liquidating Anderson:  

2317

 “[T]he CDO business liquidated 3 warehouses for deals of $530mm (about half risk was
subprime related). ... One more CDO warehouse may be liquidated this week -
approximately $300mm with GSC as manager.”

2318

  

Three days later, David Rosenblum, head of Goldman’s Collateralized Loan Obligations  activities,
emailed Mr. Ostrem, head of the CDO Origination Desk, stating:  “Dan tells me that SP [Structured
Product] CDO desk has reported -77 [million dollars] from retained debt (Hmezz 1+2, etc), and
-129 [million dollars] from unrealized and realized CDO WH [warehouse] markdowns.”

2319

  

On February 24, 2007, a Saturday, several persons from the Mortgage Department worked to

analyze the costs of unwinding and liquidating the assets collected for the Anderson CDO.  Deeb
Salem, a trader on the ABS Desk, estimated that unwinding Anderson would result in a $60 million
loss due to the falling value of its single name CDS.
  On the same day, Mr. Ostrem sent his
colleagues this explanation of why the losses in the CDO warehouse accounts were growing so
rapidly:

2320

“Each warehouse is marked by either (a) MTM [mark-to-market] on each asset or (b) mark
to model [MTModel] which involves taking the portfolio through the expected CDO
execution and calculating Goldman’s P&L [profit and loss] given current market yields on
debt and equity.  MTM is preferred if CDO execution is highly uncertain or portfolio is

small.  Both the MTM and the MTModel take into account risk sharing arrangements with
3rd parties. 

As CDO execution has become more uncertain we have moved a couple warehouses closer
to their MTM which has significantly increased our losses.  Also, our MTModel results have
shown losses as expected liability spreads have widened significantly and the overall
strength of the CDO market has waned due to fundamental credit decline in 06/07 in RMBS
subprime (90+% of assets) and increased co[r]relation between ABX/TABX levels and
mezz debt levels in CDOs.  We expect this co[r]relation to increase volatility in our
warehouse marks for the [sic] a while (this series of events have happened quickly within
the last month and the co[r]relation is getting closer to 1 as global markets get more familiar
with fundamentals in subprime and trading levels in ABX/TABX). 

Additional losses have also resulted from the liquidation of 3 warehouses.  In each case, the
realized loss from the sale of assets has been higher than our MTM or MTModel.  This is
attributable to both volatility in subprime markets and that our competitors are closing their
CDO warehouse accounts from buying our subprime or CDO positions.  The buyer base has
suddenly shrunk significantly.  As this continues, we expect this lack of liquidity to further
weaken our MTMs and feed into our losses in our remaining warehouse marks.”

2321

 

At about 11 p.m. that Saturday night, February 24, 2007, Mr. Sparks seemed to reach a
decision to liquidate Anderson.  He sent an email to Mr. Ostrem, Mr. Bieber, and several others
stating:  “I want to liquidate Anderson Monday –  we should begin the discussion with gsc asap.”

likely buyers of the Anderson securities to present to Mr. Sparks, and brainstormed about other
CDOs that could potentially buy Anderson securities for their asset pools.
  Mr. Ostrem also
proposed allowing a hedge fund to short assets into the deal as an incentive to buy the Anderson
securities, but Mr. Bieber thought Mr. Sparks would want to “preserve that ability for Goldman.”2325

2324

2323

At some point, Mr. Sparks changed his mind and decided to go forward with underwriting

the Anderson CDO.  None of the Goldman personnel interviewed by the Subcommittee could recall
why the final decision was made to go forward with Anderson.  In one email on March 2, 2007,
Jonathan Egol, head of the Goldman Correlation Trading Desk, suggested adding $195 million
more in assets to Anderson, with Goldman selecting the assets internally and shorting them.

Sparks rejected any expansion of Anderson, responding:  “we are not ramping - execute deal as
is.”

   

2327

The Anderson CDO closed on March 20, 2007.  As finally constructed, 100% of its assets
were CDS contracts referencing $307 million in mezzanine subprime RMBS securities, meaning
RMBS securities carrying BBB or BBB- credit ratings.  About 45% of the subprime mortgages in
the referenced RMBS securities were issued by New Century.  Another 8% were issued by
Countrywide, and almost 7% were issued by Fremont.  Goldman took about 40% of the short side
of the Anderson CDO.  Ten other investors held the rest of the short interest in the CDO.  

Selling Anderson.  During March, selling Anderson securities became a top priority for
Goldman.  Goldman even put another deal on hold, the Abacus 2007-AC1 deal with the Paulson
hedge fund, to promote Anderson.  As Mr. Egol advised Goldman personnel:  “Given risk priorities,
subprime news and market conditions, we need to discuss side-lining [Abacus 2007-AC1] in favor
of prioritizing Anderson in the short term.”

2328

  

On March 13, 2007, Goldman issued internal talking points for its sales force on the

Anderson CDO.  Among the points highlighted were:

“Portfolio selected by GSC.  Goldman is underwriting the equity and expects to hold up to
50%. ... Low fee structure[.] ...  No reinvestment risk.”

2329

  

The talking points described Goldman as holding up to 50% of the equity tranche in the CDO –
worth about $21 million, without mentioning that Goldman would also be holding 40% – about
$135 million – of the short side of Anderson, placing its investment interests in direct opposition to
the investors to whom it was selling Anderson securities. 

The large number of poor assets referenced in Anderson raised investor questions and was

an impediment to sales.

  One potential investor wrote to a Goldman sales representative

talking points with which to respond to the investor:

  Goldman and GSC prepared a list of

“- Historically New Century has on average displayed much better performance in terms
   of delinq[uency] and default data 
- Prepayments have tended to be higher lowering the extension risk 
- Losses and REO [Real Estate Owned by a lender taking possession of a property] are
  historically lower than the rest of the market 
- Traditionally the structures have strong enhancement/subordination.”

   

2335

The talking points did not disclose that, in fact, Goldman, too, was uncomfortable with New

Century mortgages.  On March 8, 2007, five days before receiving the investor’s inquiry, Mr.
Sparks had reported to senior Goldman executives, including Co-President Gary Cohn and CFO
David Viniar, that New Century mortgages “remain[ed] a problem for [early payment default].”
 
2336
On March 13, the same day as the investor inquiry, Goldman personnel completed a review of New
Century mortgages with early payment defaults that were on Goldman’s books and found fraud,
“material compliance issues,” and collateral problems.  The review found that “62% of the pool has
not made any pmts [payments]” and recommended “putting back 26% of the pool” to New Century

Goldman was deciding whether to underwrite Anderson, Fred Horton, head of CDOs at GSC, left the firm.  While

Losing Money from Anderson.  Due to its inability to sell two-thirds of the Anderson

securities, Goldman lost money overall on the CDO.  Goldman’s biggest gain came from holding
40% of the short position on certain Anderson assets, which produced a $131 million gain at the
direct expense of the investors to whom Goldman had sold the Anderson securities.  Goldman was
also paid $200,000 for serving as the liquidation agent,
premiums while it warehoused Anderson assets.

Despite those gains, Goldman incurred a $185 million loss from the Anderson securities it

was unable to sell and had to keep on its books.  It incurred another $122 million loss due to the
decreased value of the securities Goldman had purchased as collateral for the CDO.

Century who were known for issuing poor quality loans.  When potential investors asked how
Goldman was able to “get comfortable” with the New Century mortgage pools referenced in
Anderson, Goldman attempted to dispel concerns about the New Century loans, withheld
information about its own discomfort with New Century, and withheld that it was taking 40% of the
short side of the CDO, essentially betting against the very securities it was selling to its clients. 
Instead, Goldman instructed its sales force to tell potential investors that Goldman was buying up to
50% of the equity tranche.  Goldman also did not disclose to potential investors that it had almost
cancelled the CDO due to the falling value of its assets.

CC.  Timberwolf I

Timberwolf I was a $1 billion hybrid CDO  transaction that Goldman constructed,

underwrote, and sold.  It contained or referenced A rated CDO securities which, in turn, referenced
primarily BBB rated RMBS securities.  The assets in Timberwolf were selected by Greywolf
Capital Management, a registered investment adviser, with the approval of Goldman.  Greywolf
served as the collateral manager of the CDO.
  Goldman effectively served as the collateral put
provider.

  Timberwolf was initiated in the summer of 2006, and closed in March 2007.

and investing in CDOs.  In the summer of 2006, Peter Ostrem, head of Goldman’s CDO Origination
Desk, approached Greg Mount, a former Goldman trader working for Greywolf, and asked if
Greywolf would be interested in managing a CDO  transaction.
  Goldman and Greywolf
negotiated a risk sharing agreement, and worked through the profitability of the CDO  under
expected market conditions.  Greg Mount, as well as Joseph Marconi, another former Goldman
trader, obtained approval from Greywolf’s Chief Investment Officer to manage the CDO.

Greywolf agreed to purchase half of the Timberwolf equity tranche, sharing that risk with

2359

Goldman.
  In addition, Greywolf agreed to share with Goldman the risk of the assets being
purchased for the CDO falling in value before the CDO issued its securities.  Greywolf also 
accepted the responsibility of selecting the assets with the approval of Goldman, which would then
keep them in a warehouse account for the Timberwolf CDO.  Greywolf agreed to provide ongoing
surveillance of the performance of the assets in the CDO and liquidate any assets deemed to be
impaired. 

Constructing Timberwolf.  In September 2006, Greywolf began identifying, purchasing,
and warehousing CDO securities or single name CDS referencing CDO securities for Timberwolf.

Goldman’s warehouse balance sheet.

2360

Once an asset was approved by both Greywolf and Goldman, it was acquired in one of two

ways.  In most instances, Greywolf circulated a list of the CDO securities or reference CDO
securities that it was interested in buying to the broker-dealer community to get bids.  To buy a
single name CDS, Goldman wrote the CDS contract, taking the long side on behalf of Greywolf,
while the broker-dealer who provided the best bid took the short side.  The CDS contract would
then be held by Goldman in the Timberwolf warehouse account until the CDO was ready to
close.

including $15 million in single name CDS contracts naming Abacus securities.
Goldman held 36% of the short interest in Timberwolf.
  Altogether, Timberwolf contained 56
different assets, of which 51 were single name CDS contracts referencing CDO securities and five
were cash CDO securities.
  The 51 single name CDS contracts referenced both CDO and CDO

securities, and each CDO or CDO  security contained or referenced its own RMBS, CMBS, or CDO
securities or other assets.  In total, Timberwolf had over 4,500 unique underlying securities and a
grand total of almost 7,000 securities.
  This process was further complicated by the fact that the
CDO assets in Timberwolf were privately issued and often had little or no publicly available
information on the underlying assets they contained.

better spread.  Goldman would then have the option of providing the remaining $5-10 million in CDS protection at

By the time Greywolf and Goldman were nearing completion of the acquisition of the

543

Timberwolf assets in the spring of 2007, Goldman was becoming increasingly concerned about the
deteriorating subprime mortgage market and the falling value of the assets in its CDO warehouse
accounts.  In February 2007, Mr. Sparks, the Mortgage Department head, and Goldman senior
executive Thomas Montag exchanged emails about the warehouse risk posed by Timberwolf and
another pending CDO  called Point Pleasant.  Mr. Montag asked Mr. Sparks:  “cdo squared–how
big and how dangerous?”
  Mr. Sparks responded: “[R]oughly 2bb [billion], and they are the
deals to worry about.”  Mr. Sparks also told Mr. Montag that, due to falling subprime prices, the
assets accumulated in the warehouse account for the $1 billion Timberwolf CDO had already
incurred significant losses, those losses had eaten through all of Greywolf’s portion of the
warehouse risk sharing agreement, and any additional drops in value would be Goldman’s exclusive
obligation.

2369

2368

In March 2007, due to the falling values of subprime RMBS and CDO securities, Goldman

decided against completing several CDOs under construction, and liquidated the assets in their
warehouse accounts.  Goldman decided, in contrast, to accelerate completion of Timberwolf.
2370

   

Timberwolf I closed on March 27, 2007, approximately six weeks ahead of schedule.

 
2371
The final CDO had $1 billion in cash and synthetic assets, including $960 million in single name
CDS referencing CDO securities, and $56 million in cash CDO securities.  

Selling Timberwolf.  Selling Timberwolf securities became a high priority for Goldman. 
Mr. Sparks worked with senior sales managers to review ideas, telling them:  “I can’t over state the
importance to the business of selling these positions and new issues.”

During the spring and summer of 2007, the Goldman Syndicate

a sales manager offering “ginormous credits” as an incentive to sell Goldman’s CDO securities:

  Mr. Sparks was
informed in response:  “[W]e have done that with timberwolf already.”

2379

On March 9, 2007, Harvey Schwartz, a senior executive at Goldman Sachs, expressed

concern to Mr. Sparks and others about what Goldman sales personnel were telling clients: “Seems
to me ... one of our biggest issues is how we communicate our views of the market – consistently
with what the desk wants to execute.”
  Mr. Sparks responded by outlining several concerns and
the need for the sales team and traders to work together.

   He wrote:

2381

2382

“3 things to keep in mind: 
(1) The market is so volatile and dislocated that priorities and relative value situations
change dramatically and constantly. 
(2) Liquidity is so light that discretion with information is very important to allow execution
and avoid getting run over.  
(3) The team is working incredibly hard and is stretched.”

He concluded:  “Priority 1 – sell our new issues and our cash positions.” 

Pricing Timberwolf Securities.  Despite the urgency communicated by Goldman

management, Timberwolf sales slowed.  By May 11, 2007, only one Timberwolf sale had taken
place in the previous several weeks.
Timberwolf securities, and the value of their underlying assets, were falling.

545

On May 11, 2007, Mr. Sparks notified Goldman senior executives that marking down the

value of the unsold CDO securities so that, internally, the firm understood their current market
value had become a “real issue”: 

“Cdo positions and market liquidity and transparency have seized.  I posted senior guys that
I felt there is a real issue. ... We are going to have a very large markdown – multiple
hundreds. Not good.”

2385

 

That same evening, Mr. Lehman sent out a “Gameplan” to colleagues in the Mortgage Department
announcing that Goldman was going to undertake a detailed valuation of its CDO  securities using
three different valuation methods, and would also take “a more detailed look” at the values of the
assets in the CDO warehouse accounts and in Goldman’s own inventory.

2386

 

2

Also on May 11, Chief Credit Officer Craig Broderick sent an email to his team to set up a
survey of Goldman clients who might encounter financial difficulty if Goldman lowered the value
of the CDO securities they had purchased.
  As explained earlier, some Goldman clients had
purchased their CDO securities with financing supplied by Goldman that required them to post
more cash margin if the financed securities lost value.  Other clients had invested in the CDO
securities by taking the long side of a CDS contract with Goldman and also had to post more cash
collateral if the value of the CDO securities declined.  All of these clients would also have to record
a loss on their books due to the lowered valuations. 

2387

With respect to the CDO securities that had yet to be sold, Goldman senior executive Harvey

Schwartz raised another issue related to lowering the values of the CDO securities Goldman was
selling to clients:  “[D]on’t think we can trade this with our clients andf [sic] then mark them down
dramatically the next day. ...  Needs to be a discussion if that risk exists.”
Sparks, Mr. Montag, and Mr. Schwartz, Goldman senior executive Donald Mullen acknowledged
concerns “about the representations we may be making to clients as well as how we will price assets
once we sell them to clients.”
efforts to sell Timberwolf securities if they got “strong bids.”

  The executives also agreed, however, not to “slow or delay”

  In an email to Mr.

The CDO valuation project generated many comments on how to price the firm’s unsold
CDO securities, including Timberwolf.  One Goldman employee, who was applying Goldman’s
most common valuation method to Timberwolf, wrote that the price should be dramatically lower:

“Based on current single-A CDO marks, the A2 tranche of Timberwolf would have a price of 72
cents on the dollar.”

  He also noted:

2391

546

“Based on a small sample of single-A CDOs for which we have a complete underlier marks,
we believe that the risks of the RMBS underliers are frequently not fully reflected in the
marks on the CDOs.  If the trends in this small sample are extrapolated, the fair spread on
the CDOs could even be double where they are marked now; if that were the case, the price
of the A2 tranche of Timberwolf would actually be 35-41 cents on the dollar, depending on
the correlation.”

2392

  

Several days later, in preparation for a meeting with senior executives on the valuation issue, the
same Goldman employee calculated that, for the A2 tranche of Timberwolf, the “price based on
CDO marks” was 66 cents on the dollar, while the “price based on RMBS marks” was 24 cents on
the dollar.2393

Throughout the valuation process, senior management, including Co-President Gary Cohn,
was kept posted on how the Mortgage Department planned to value the firm’s CDO assets.
  On
Sunday, May 20, 2007, the Mortgage Department presented its findings in a 9:00 p.m. conference

CDOs.
  The presentation stated:  “[T]he desk is most concerned about the CDO^2 positions,
comprised of the recent Timberwolf and Point Pleasant transactions. The lack of liquidity in this
space and the complexity of the product make these extremely difficult to value.”

Despite Goldman’s internal analysis that the value of the Timberwolf securities was in rapid
decline, the firm did not lower the prices at which it marketed the securities to clients.  In a May 14
email, Mr. Sparks explained his Timberwolf pricing strategy to Mr. Mullen and Mr. Montag:

“I think we should take the write-down, but market at much higher levels.  I’m a little
concerned we are overly negative and ahead of the market, and that we could end up leaving
some money on the table – but I’m not saying we shouldn’t find and hit some bids.”

had engaged Basis Capital several months earlier as a collateral manager of a CDO Goldman was underwriting
called Fort Denison.  Mr. Ostrem, head of the CDO Origination Desk, apparently had a low opinion of the firm,

2406

 

In addition to marketing its CDOs at inflated prices compared to its internal valuations, the
Mortgage Department told some clients that the mortgage market was strengthening.  On May 14,
2007, for example, Edwin Chin, a trader on the Mortgage Department’s ABS Desk, sent this upbeat
commentary to both Goldman traders and clients:

“Incredible as it may seem, the subprime mortgage slump is already [a] distant memory for
some.  It’s been two months since the ABX market plunged amid worries about a housing
meltdown, and already investors (and some dealers) are beginning to get ‘complacent’ again. 
Blame it on the CDO bids, but with subprime production projected down 40-60% from last
year’s level, appetite for spread products triumphs any risk concern in the marketplace right
now.  ABX Index is trading higher as dealers short cover their single name positions after a
month of range-bound trading.  Flows continue to weigh toward better seller of protection –
longs outpace shorts by 3 to 1 as CDO demand has been robust the last two weeks. While
warehouse activities might be slow, many CDOs are still looking to finish up their ramp
post-closing.”2407

Daniel Sparks responded to Edwin Chin’s commentary by asking senior ABS traders, David
Lehman, Mike Swenson, and Joshua Birnbaum:  “Is this a head fake or does this make you bullish
on all spread product?”  Mr. Lehman responded:  “[G]iven the sizable short interest in
ABS/subprime mkt it does not surprise me that short covering is pushing spds [spreads] tighter. Not
sure I would enter new longs here.”  Mr. Swenson responded:  “I would characterize this as a great
opportunity to be constructive on the market.”

Goldman response to Subcommittee QFR at PSI_QFR_GS0223 and PSI_QFR_GS0235.  In an interview with the
Subcommittee, David Lehman explained that the bid/offer spread (the difference between the price at which a
security is offered for sale [“offer price”] and the price at which a bank would buy the same security [“bid price”])
was the reason for the difference between Goldman’s internal valuation of the price of the AA rated securities and
price at which it sold them to Bank Hapoalim.  However, in many instances during this period, it appeared as if
Goldman’s internal valuation price had no relationship to the bid and offer prices quoted to clients.  For example, at
the end of June 2007, Goldman provided Timberwolf investor Moneygram with an offer price of $86 for Timberwolf
A2 securities and bid price of $83, indicating a bid/offer spread of 3 points.  Meanwhile, Goldman had an internal
valuation of $75 for the same securities, far different from $83 and $86 quoted to Moneygram.  See Moneygram
valuation, 7/5/2007 email from Goldman Sachs Operations, “MoneyGram Marks from GS as of 06/29/07,” GS
MBS-E-022023387; Goldman internal evaluations see “Warehouse SP CDO positions and hedges_6-29-07,” GS

MBS-E-010795809.  Goldman’s pricing in such situations seemed consistent with the strategy articulated earlier by
Mr. Sparks, the head of the Mortgage Department, that Goldman should write down the value of the assets, “but
market [the CDO securities] at much higher levels,” because he was concerned that Goldman was “overly negative
and ahead of the market, and that [Goldman] could end up leaving some money on the table.”  5/14/2007 email from

Timberwolf Sales to Basis Capital.  At the conclusion of the CDO valuation project, which

found that Timberwolf and Goldman’s other CDO securities had lost significant value, the
Mortgage Department resumed its efforts to push Timberwolf sales.  

 On Sunday, May 20, 2007, the same day the Mortgage Department made its valuation

presentation to Mr. Viniar and recommended targeting Basis Capital for CDO sales, George
Maltezos, the Goldman sales representative responsible for Basis Capital, emailed Mr. Lehman
saying he would contact the Basis Capital principals immediately upon their return from a business
trip the following day.

2411

  

Mr. Maltezos began pressing Basis Capital to buy the securities.  On May 22, Mr. Maltezos

urged Basis Capital to consider buying the securities before the end of the quarter:

“I appreciate you are flat chat [busy] at the moment, but pls [please] keep in mind GS is an
aggressive seller of risk for QTR [quarter] end purposes (last day of quarter is this Friday). 
We would certainly appreciate your support, and equally help create something where the
return on invested capital for Basis is over 60%.”2412

At the same time Mr. Maltezos was claiming that a Timberwolf investment could provide over a
60% return on invested capital, Goldman’s internal marks were showing that Timberwolf was
continuing to fall in value. 

Basis Capital indicated that it was interested in the Timberwolf securities, but had several

issues it needed to work through.  First, Basis Capital indicated that Goldman would have to help it

2409
2410
we establish a defined + healthy supply/demand dynamic in this product we can always create more CDO^2 at a
significant profit vs current levels,” meaning that since Goldman’s internal marks were so much lower than the bids it
was providing clients, if a client chose to buy additional securities at Goldman’s bid price, Goldman could sell the
securities by taking a short position on a CDS facing the client, and make money on the trade.  6/6/2007 email from

In May and June 2007, Mr. Maltezos worked to convince Basis Capital to purchase $100
million in Timberwolf securities.  At one point Basis Capital pressed for a lower sales price, but
was told by Mr. Maltezos:  “I don’t think the trading desk shares the sentiment with regard to such
spread levels [lower prices].”
  During the negotiations over the Timberwolf sale, on June 12,
2007, Goldman again marked down the value of the Point Pleasant securities to $75, and again

“From a pricing perspective, we have been trading Timberwolf AAA and AA bonds.  550 dm on AAAs and north of

discount margins correspond to greater markdowns from par prices.  See e.g. Timberwolf I, Price-DM Table 05-16-

Mr. Sparks was closely monitoring Mr. Maltezos’ ongoing effort to sell the Timberwolf

that you moved 100mm [$100 million].”

2424

  

In response, Mr. Maltezos coordinated a call between Basis Capital and Mr. Lehman to “clarify any
and all questions you have on the marking policy of Goldman, the actual marking of Point Pleasant,
and the overall trading that has been seen by the [Goldman] desk in the last 1-6 months.”
  In that
telephone call with Basis Capital, Mr. Lehman apparently corrected Mr. Maltezos’ misstatement
about recent Timberwolf sales, and Mr. Maltezos followed up with an email to Basis Capital:

2425

“[P]lease accept my sincerest apologies for the mis-information below.  As David
mentioned, the 75 mark on Pt Pleasant BBB was more reflective of an interpretation of
softer AAA-AA rated CDO-sqd paper translating to BBB part of the curve.”

Later that same day, June 13, 2007, Mr. Lehman reported that Goldman had reached

agreement on $100 million in Timberwolf sales to Basis Capital.  The sale consisted of the hedge
fund taking the long side of a CDS contract with Goldman, referencing $50 million in AAA rated

In early June, Goldman targeted a Korean insurance company called Hungkuk Life for

Timberwolf sales.  According to a Goldman employee in the Japan sales office, Jay Lee, “the largest
hurdle from the client perspective is whether or not they can get the mandate to buy something
backed by synthetically sourced CDO’s [sic], as they have never bought CDO^2 before.”
  Mr.
Lee was also concerned that the value of the securities would drop soon after the office sold the
Timberwolf securities to the insurance company.  Mr. Lee stated:

2445

“[T]he largest hurdle from a sales’ perspective is MTM [mark to market].  It is an important
client, and if the mark widens out more than 1pt immediately after selling the asset to them,
sales cannot sell it.  Understanding that it is a volatile asset, sales wants to know that where
we sell it to the client will not be more than 1pt less than where the mark would be, provided
no new market information.”

2446

  

It is unclear how his valuation concern was addressed.  Later the same day, on June 1, Mr. Lee
reported that Hungkuk Life had purchased $36 million in AAA rated Timberwolf securities.  Mr.
Sparks responded “good job – keep going.”

2447

  

Six days later, on June 7, 2007, the head of the Goldman Japan sales office, Omar

Chaudhary, contacted Mr. Sparks and Mr. Lehman about a possible additional sale of Timberwolf
securities to Hungkuk Life.  Mr. Chaudhary wrote that the head of Goldman’s Korean sales office
was “pushing on our personal relationships” to make the sale and wanted to be assured he’d be paid
more if he “got it done”:

“Jay and I spoke to the head of Korea Sales today.  He said that he feels we can push for
H[ungkuk] Life to increase their size from the 36mm of AAA’s and wanted to see if we
would pay more GC’s [sales credits] if he got it done.  Told him that if we sell ~45-50mm+

[expected price].  Trust you will support this as we are pushing on our personal relationships
to get this done.”

Mr. Lehman and Mr. Sparks told Mr. Chaudhary to “go for it” and “[g]et ‘er done.”
  The Korean
office did get it done, and Goldman sold another $56 million in Timberwolf securities to Hungkuk
Life at a price of $84.50.

On June 11, 2007, Mr. Lehman received an email from the Goldman Syndicate asking

whether the CDO axe sheet, which included directives to sell Timberwolf securities, could be sent
to the Japan sales office for re-distribution to sales representatives across Asia.  Mr. Lehman agreed: 
“let’s send to all Japan sales.”

  Two days later, on June 13, 2007, the Japan sales office reported

2454

Mr. Montag continued to monitor the sales of Timberwolf as well as other CDO securities in

Goldman’s inventory and warehouse accounts.  On June 22, 2007, Mr. Sparks reported to him on
the completion of a number of sales of CDO and RMBS securities that Goldman had purchased
from the two failed Bear Stearns hedge funds.  Mr. Montag asked Mr. Sparks to provide him with a
“complete rundown” on “what[’]s left.”
  Mr. Sparks responded that the “main thing left” was
$300 million in Timberwolf securities.  Mr. Montag responded:  “boy that timeberwo[l]f was one
shitty deal.”

2456

2457

 

Despite Mr. Montag’s assessment of Timberwolf, he continued to press for the sale of

Timberwolf securities to Goldman clients.  On June 25, 2007, Mr. Sparks emailed Mr. Montag and
others with another update on selling Goldman’s remaining CDO assets.
  Mr. Sparks informed
the group that Goldman would probably have to lower the values of the CDO assets over the next

Goldman ultimately sold about $853 million of the $1 billion in Timberwolf securities to
about 12 investors.  The unsold securities, with a face value of about $150 million, remained on
Goldman’s books.  

Limited Disclosures.  Despite their aggressive sales efforts, Goldman sales personnel

typically did not help potential investors analyze the Timberwolf securities and the 4,500 unique
assets underlying the CDO.  One Goldman employee told his colleagues:  “In terms of telling
customers. I prefer to give them the general idea of the trade.  Then give them the excel spread sheet
with our info on ref obs [reference obligations] and let them draw their own conclusions.”
Another Goldman employee, discussing a potential buyer of Timberwolf, warned:

2464

 

“[H]e is going to want to look at the TWOLF trade on a fundamental basis with a lot of
supporting runs to back up any additional mark downs we have – telling him we are busy
when it comes to month end and we can’t run that analysis because we are resource-
constrained will not be good enough.”

information to potential investors.  On May 20, 2007, the same day the Mortgage Department presented the
conclusions of its CDO valuation project to Mr. Viniar and others, Mr. Wiesel sent an email to Mr. Bieber
underscoring concerns about its valuation process:  “[G]iven how complex the data is for a CDO^2, there’s little
chance we’ll ever get fully ‘comfortable’ beyond a shadow of a doubt that there’s nothing materially misleading in
the data cuts we provide.  Is best outcome in this situation to just get a big-boy letter drafted?”  5/20/2007 email from

Still another Goldman employee stated with respect to Timberwolf and Point Pleasant:  “The
trickiest part about sharing this [pricing] analysis with custies [customers] is that it shows just how
rudimentary our own understanding of these positions actually is.”

2466

 

Goldman also in many instances refused to provide investors with its pricing methodology
or specific prices or values for the CDO securities it was selling.  After its securities began to lose
value, Basis Capital emailed George Maltezos, David Lehman, and others asking:  “How many
times do we have to request data points and scenarios by email. These were read out to us on the
call and it was agreed that GS would send them through. I am getting weary of continually hearing
about transparency and yet an obvious avoidance of ‘putting things to paper.’”2467

Similarly, when Hungkuk Life requested additional information about the underlying

Timberwolf assets, Goldman sent an asset report, but only after removing all of its pricing and
valuing information related to those assets.
  In August 2007, Jay Lee from Goldman’s Japan
sales office told a sales associate who was seeking information about Goldman’s marks for Tokyo
Star Bank:

2468

“[U]nder no circumstances are we going to be able to provide materials specific to
Timberwolf ... or even use the word ‘mark’ in written materials. ...  Everything will be
described in general terms, and if what we provide is too vague or general, the medium for
further clarification must be oral, not written.”

2469

  

Mr. Lehman added:  “[W]e should be clear that the information we are providing is not our pricing
methodology but rather some tho[ugh]ts on the current market.”

2470

  

In an interview with the Subcommittee, Mr. Lehman defended Goldman’s aggressive

markdowns by noting that Goldman would buy or sell at the prices it quoted to a customer.  He
explained that if a client thought Goldman’s mark was too low, the client could buy more of the
securities from Goldman at the low price, then resell them for a profit.  Since Goldman’s internal
valuations were much lower than the price quoted to clients, however, such sales would still
produce a profit for the firm.
  Furthermore, as Goldman marked down the values in the summer
of 2007, it began to decrease the volume of the securities it was willing to buy or sell at the prices it
quoted to clients.  Goldman was initially willing to buy or sell CDO securities in blocks of $10
million, but by July, it lowered the maximum size to $3 million for some securities and $1 million
for others:  “Given current market environment, we would like our bid for size for CDO valuations

“A Day That Will Live In Infamy.”  The Timberwolf securities issued by Goldman

steadily lost money from the day they were issued.  Less than four months after they were issued, on
July 16, 2007, Mr. Lehman instructed the Timberwolf deal captain, Mr. Bieber, to “create an
‘unwind’ spreadsheet ... where we can input CDS spds [spreads]/prices and liability prices so we
can determine if unwinding these deals makes sense.”
  The analysis appeared to show that it
would cost Goldman $140 million to unwind Timberwolf, and the conclusion was to “Hold Off.”
Instead of unwinding, Goldman continued its sales push.

In September 2007, Mr. Montag asked for data tracking the drop in prices for a Goldman

employee provided prices for the A2 tranche of the Timberwolf securities using a combination of
Goldman’s internal marks and the bids provided to investors, from the issuance of the CDO on
March 27, 2007 through September.  The data showed that, in six months, prices for Timberwolf’s
AAA rated A2 security had fallen from $94 per security to $15, a drop of almost 80%:

Goldman profited in part from Timberwolf’s decline in value due to its 36% short interest in the
CDO.  In addition, June was the month that Goldman built its $13.9 billion big short, which meant
that the decline in most mortgage related assets translated into increasing profits for Goldman.2478

Timberwolf experienced its first credit rating downgrades in November 2007, just eight
months after the CDO closed and issued its securities.  The downgrades included the AAA rated
securities.  In March 2008, one year after Timberwolf was issued, its AAA securities were
downgraded to junk status.  In June 2008, a controlling class of debt investors voted to liquidate
Timberwolf, and the deal was terminated in October 2008.2479

Goldman’s 36% short position in Timberwolf produced about $330 million in revenues at
the direct expense of the clients to whom Goldman had sold the Timberwolf securities.  Goldman
also made $3 million in interest while the Timberwolf assets were in Goldman’s warehouse
account.  At the same time, because Goldman was unable to sell about a third of the Timberwolf
securities and had to keep the unsold securities on its books, it ended up losing $562 million from
them.  Goldman also lost $226 million from the decline in the value of the collateral securities
securing the CDO.  When offset by the profits from its Timberwolf short, Goldman ended up with a
total loss of about $455 million.

2480

 

Timberwolf’s investors lost virtually their entire investments.  Basis Capital ended up

declaring bankruptcy and has filed suit against Goldman.2481

Analysis.  Goldman constructed Timberwolf using CDO assets that began to fall in value
almost as soon as the Timberwolf securities were issued, yet solicited clients to buy the securities. 
Timberwolf contained or referenced CDO assets with more than 4,500 unique mortgage related
securities, but Goldman offered potential investors little help in understanding those securities, and
targeted clients with limited or no experience in CDO investments.  When marketing Timberwolf,
Goldman withheld its internal marks showing the securities losing value and did not mention its
short position.  Senior Goldman executives knew the firm was selling poor quality assets at inflated
prices.  Within six months of issuance, AAA Timberwolf securities lost almost 80% of their value. 
Due to its short position, Goldman profited at the expense of the clients to whom it sold the
Timberwolf securities, but it lost money overall because Goldman was forced to retain so many of
the unsold Timberwolf securities on its books.

Responding to Paulson Inquiry.  In mid to late 2006, Goldman was approached by the

hedge fund Paulson & Co. Inc. (Paulson), and asked to structure a transaction that would enable the
hedge fund to short multiple RMBS securities.
  Goldman had previously worked with Paulson
and was aware that Paulson held strong negative views of the residential mortgage market and was
making investments based on that view.  The Goldman Mortgage Capital Committee Memorandum
seeking approval of Abacus 2007-AC1, for example, stated:

2493

“Paulson is a macro hedge fund that has taken directional views on the subprime RMBS
market for the past few months.  In 2006 the Desk worked an order for Paulson to buy
protection on a supersenior tranche off a portfolio similar to the Reference Portfolio selected
by ACA, and the AC1 Transaction is another means for Paulson to accomplish their trading
objective:  buying protection in tranched format on the subprime RMBS market.”2494

An email sent to Daniel Sparks, head of the Mortgage Department, by Fabrice Tourre, a Correlation
Trading Desk employee who led the effort on the Abacus CDO for Paulson, was even more blunt:

  “Subordination” is “[t]he measure of losses that must occur within a portfolio before a tranche is at risk to loss.” 

2490
Tranche size “[r]eflects the notional (value-at-risk) of a structured credit investment” and “is also a measure of
leverage.”  7/2006 Goldman presentation, “Structured Credit Investments,” at 54, GS MBS-E-002055378; 4/2006
Goldman presentation, “Overview of Structured Products,” GS MBS-E-016067482.  Goldman contended that, in a
single-tranche CDO, investors could customize the tranche risk/return profile by specifying the tranche subordination
and tranche size, and that investors could create “credit enhanced” credit exposure through the use of subordination. 
4/2006 Goldman presentation, “Overview of Structured Products,” at 52, GS MBS-E-016067482.  “Combined with
tranche size, varying levels of subordination enable investors to tailor both the structural leverage and the risk/return
profile of their investment.”  “Investors are “[n]ot limited by new issuance calendar and bond allocations,” are “[n]ot
limited by cash bonds in dealer inventory,” can “customize[] by sector (e.g. RMBS, CMBS, ABS), rating, vintage,
servicer, etc.,” and can “meet various investment objectives via structure.”  7/2006 Goldman presentation,

“Gerstie and I are finishing up engagement letters ... for the large RMBS CDO Abacus trade
that will help Paulson short senior tranches off a reference portfolio of Baa2 subprime
RMBS risk selected by ACA.”

   

2495

These documents make it clear that Goldman knew Paulson’s investment strategy was to
identify a reference portfolio of assets for the Abacus CDO that Paulson believed would perform
poorly or fail, so that its short position would profit at the expense of the long investors.
  In
addition, during his Subcommittee interview, Mr. Tourre made it clear that he was aware of the
Paulson investment strategy.

   

2496

2497

In response to the inquiry from Paulson, Goldman proposed structuring an Abacus CDO.

 
2498
Fabrice Tourre was given lead responsibility for organizing and structuring the Abacus transaction. 
Goldman’s primary role was to act as an agent and administrator of the CDO, obtaining its profit
from the fees it charged for the services rendered, rather than from any investment in the CDO
itself.  In effect, Goldman “rented” the Abacus platform to the Paulson hedge fund and served as
Paulson’s agent in carrying out the hedge fund’s investment objectives.  Mr. Tourre had been
suggesting that Goldman employ such an approach and supported the arrangement.

2499

 

Finding a Portfolio Selection Agent.  According to Mr. Tourre, Paulson suggested that

Goldman employ an outside portfolio selection agent for the CDO.
Paulson’s Managing Director who led Paulson’s selection of the reference assets for the Abacus
2007-AC1 transaction, told the SEC that it was Goldman’s idea to have a portfolio selection
agent.
  At the same time, Goldman internal communications made it clear that the objective was
to select a portfolio selection agent that would comply with Paulson’s suggestions for the assets to
be referenced in the CDO.  In an email to colleagues discussing the matter, Mr. Tourre suggested
finding a manager that:

Paulson was proposing for the CDO as “a weak quality portfolio.”).

Paulson’s selection criteria, such as interest-only mortgages and high loan-to-value ratios, were based on Paulson’s
view that securities meeting those criteria were “weaker from the credit quality standpoint than other obligations that
did not have those characteristics.”  SEC deposition of Fabrice Tourre (3/3/2009), GS MBS 0000022785, at 813-14.

“will be flexible w.r.t. [with respect to] portfolio selection (i.e. ideally we will send them a
list of 200 Baa2-rated 2006-vintage RMBS bonds that fit certain criteria, and the portfolio
selection agent will select 100 out of the 200 bonds).”

2502

  

In the early part of January 2007, Mr. Tourre sent an email to prospective selection agents

describing their anticipated role in the CDO.  One of his points was the following:

“Reference Portfolio: static, fully identified upfront, and consisting of approx 100 equally-
sized mezzanine subprime RMBS names issued between Q4 [the fourth quarter of] 2005 and
today.  Starting portfolio would be ideally what the Transaction Sponsor shared, but there is
flexibility around the names.”

2503

 

Goldman’s internal communications also suggest that Goldman was, in fact, more interested

in identifying cooperative portfolio selection agents for its own transactions, rather than locating
one for the Paulson CDO.  In an email chain discussing a portfolio selection agent for Abacus 2007-
AC1, a Goldman employee wrote to a colleague that Mr. Tourre “suggested Faxtor was a potential
portfolio selection agent [for Paulson] since they are relatively inexpensive and easy to work with.”  
The colleague responded:  “We already have a portfolio in front of Faxtor; they probably will be
willing to structure a short that I believe we would want to keep for ourselves ... not sure if this is
the best fit.”2504

Jonathan Egol, chief architect of the Abacus structure and head of the Correlation Trading
Desk, suggested that Goldman approach GSC Partners, a New York hedge fund that Goldman had
worked with on other CDOs, including Anderson.  Mr. Tourre sent an email to colleagues asking:

“Do you think gsc is easier to work with than faxtor?  They will never agree to the type of
names paulson wants to use, I don’t think steffelin [a senior trader at GSC] will be willing to
put gsc’s name at risk for small economics on a weak quality portfolio whose bonds are
distributed globally.”

2505

  

A colleague replied:

“There are more managers out there than just GSC / Faxtor.  The way I look at it, the easiest
managers to work with should be used for our own axes.  Managers that are a bit more

difficult should be used for trades like Paulson given how axed Paulson seems to be (i.e. I’m
betting they can give on certain terms and overall portfolio increase).”2506

On January 4, 2007, on behalf of Paulson, Goldman approached GSC Partners as well as
two other companies to act as the portfolio selection agent for the Abacus CDO.
  Following a
meeting among representatives of Goldman, Paulson, and GSC, Mr. Tourre sent an email to his
colleagues summarizing the meeting and indicating that Paulson was also looking for a portfolio
selection agent that would be willing to accept many of the reference assets it identified:

2507

“At the end of the meeting, the Paulson team told us that they were happy to have met GSC
and assuming that (1) GSC could get comfortable with a sufficient number of obligations
that Paulson is looking to buy protection on in ABACUS format, (2) GSC could get
comfortable being in the market as early as end of January with a transaction under which
Gsc is disclosed as Portfolio Selection Agent (without any credit risk removal rights), and
(3) Paulson, Goldman, and GSC agree[] on GSC’s required compensation for a transaction
like this, then Paulson will want to proceed with gsc as soon as possible and be in the market
as soon as possible.”

2508

  

Subsequently, Mr. Tourre reported to his colleagues that GSC had declined the offer to act

as the Abacus portfolio selection agent due to its negative views of the assets Paulson wanted to
include in the CDO:

“As you know, a couple of weeks ago we had approached GSC to ask them to act as
portfolio selection agent for that Paulson-sponsored trade, and GSC declined given their
negative views on most of the credits that Paulson had selected.”2509

Later, when Goldman began to market Abacus 2007-AC1 securities, Edward Steffelin, a
senior trader at GSC, sent an email to Peter Ostrem, head of Goldman’s CDO Origination Desk
saying: “I do not have to say how bad it is that you guys are pushing this thing.”
the Subcommittee what he meant, Mr. Steffelin responded that he believed that particular Abacus
CDO created “reputational risk” for GSC as the collateral manager and for the whole market.2511

Selecting Assets.  During January, February, and March 2007, the Abacus reference assets
were selected.  The Paulson hedge fund initiated the asset selection process by providing Goldman
with criteria for choosing RMBS securities for the CDO.
  According to Mr. Tourre, Goldman’s
subsequent identification of candidate assets was essentially ministerial, as Paulson’s specified
criteria had restricted the scope of the RMBS securities that could be proposed.
  For example,
Paulson wanted RMBS securities that had adjustable rate mortgages, low borrower FICO scores,
and mortgages in states with slowing home price appreciation, like Arizona, California, Florida, and
Nevada.
  Paulson specifically required 2006-vintage or 2007-vintage subprime RMBS that were

leadership in the market for structured product synthetic CDOs.  We expect that the role of ACA as Portfolio

structured product investors who have previously participated in ACA-managed cashflow CDO transactions or who
have previously participated in prior ABACUS transactions.”).  See also SEC Complaint against Goldman at 8.

Senator Levin then asked Mr. Tourre, “And did those criteria which Paulson gave to you, were they plugged into

  Paolo Pellegrini told the SEC that Paulson’s selection criteria for Abacus 2007-AC1 included RMBS with a
maximum weighted average FICO score of 640 and a minimum percentage (80%) of adjustable rate mortgages. 
Paulson also sought a minimum portfolio size of $750 million.  SEC deposition of Paolo Pellegrini (12/3/2008), PSI-
Paulson-04 (Pellegrini Depo)-0001, at 140-142.  Sihan Shu, an analyst working for Paulson on the Abacus 2007-
AC1 reference asset selection, told the Subcommittee that Paulson’s selection criteria generally included large
percentages of adjustable rate mortgages; high concentrations of mortgages in areas such as California and Florida,
where Paulson believed the housing bubble was greater than in other areas; and limited due diligence.  Subcommittee
interview of Sihan Shu (2/24/2010).  See also SEC deposition of Sihan Shu (12/4/2008), PSI-Paulson-04 (Shu

included a high percentage of adjustable rate mortgages, relatively low borrower FICO scores, and a high
concentration of mortgages in states like Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada that had recently experienced high
rates of home price appreciation.”  SEC Complaint against Goldman Sachs at 9.  However, Goldman’s initial
submission to the SEC listed Paulson’s criteria as only 2006-vintage subprime RMBS rated Baa2 by Moody’s.  In

than express its views; it played an active and determinative role in the asset selection process. 
Paulson established the criteria used to identify the initial list of RMBS securities, proposed a
majority of the reference assets in the final portfolio, and approved 100% of the reference assets. 
Moreover, the “views” expressed by Paulson directly conflicted with the interests of the investors to
whom Goldman was marketing the Abacus 2007-AC1 deal.  Mr. Pellegrini was quite clear about
Paulson’s intentions in a deposition with the SEC:

investor in past Abacus CDOs and was considering purchasing securities issued by Abacus 2007-

“Paulson will likely not agree to this unless we tell them that nobody will buy these bonds if we
don’t make that change.”
  Mr. Tourre expressed concern, not about what ACA, the portfolio
selection agent, might or might not agree to, but only about what the Paulson hedge fund might
agree to.

2531

Failing to Disclose Key Information.  Evidence obtained by the Subcommittee indicates
 
that Paulson’s role in the Abacus asset selection process and its investment objectives for the CDO
were not fully or accurately disclosed to key parties or investors at the time the CDO was being
structured and sold. 

Moody’s, one of the credit rating agencies asked to rate the Abacus securities, was not

informed of Paulson’s role or investment objectives.  At a Subcommittee hearing on the role of the
credit rating agencies in the financial crisis, Eric Kolchinsky, a former Moody’s managing director
who oversaw its CDO ratings and was familiar with Abacus 2007-AC1, provided sworn testimony
that he had not known of Paulson’s involvement with the CDO at the time it was rated, did not
know of Paulson’s role in selecting the referenced assets, and believed his staff did not know either. 
He testified that allowing an entity that wants a CDO to “blow up” to pick its assets “changes the
whole dynamic,” and was information that he would have wanted to know when rating the
securities:

Senator Levin:  And were you or your staff aware at the time that Moody’s was working on
the ABACUS rating that Paulson was shorting the assets in ABACUS and playing a role in
selecting referenced assets expected to perform poorly?

Mr. Kolchinsky:  I did not know, and I suspect, I am fairly sure, that my staff did not know
either.

 

Senator Levin:  And are these facts that you or your staff would have wanted to know before
rating ABACUS?

Mr. Kolchinsky:  From my personal perspective, it is something that I would have wanted to
know because it is more of a qualitative not a quantitative assessment if someone who
intends the deal to blow up is picking the portfolio.  But, yes, that is something that I would
have personally wanted to know.  It changes the incentives in the structure.

Senator Levin:  Are people usually putting deals together that want the deal to succeed? 
Isn’t that the usual assumption?

Mr. Kolchinsky:  That is the basic assumption, yes.

Senator Levin:  And if the person wanting the deal to blow up is picking the assets, that
would run counter to what the usual assumption is?

Mr. Kolchinsky:  It just changes the whole dynamic of the structure where the person who is
putting it together, choosing it, wants it to blow up.

Moody’s assigned AAA ratings to two tranches of the Abacus CDO.

  According to ACA, it

believed that Paulson was going to be a long investor in the CDO through its purchase of the equity
share that would incur the first losses in the CDO.  Contemporaneous ACA documents support that
position.  An internal ACA Commitments Committee Memorandum on Abacus 2007-AC1 dated
February 12, 2007, for example, stated:  “The hedge fund is taking the 0-9% equity tranche.”
 
2535
Ten days later, on February 23, 2007, the ACA Managing Director who worked on the Abacus
transaction spoke with a Goldman representative, and took notes of the conversation which stated in
part: “Paulson taking 0-10%.”
  In April 2007, the same ACA Managing Director sent an email to
the CEO and President of ACA’s parent company, ACA Capital Holdings Inc., which was
considering buying Abacus securities for itself.  Her email stated:  “We did price $192 million in
total of Class A1 and A2 today to settle April 26th.  Paulson took down a proportionate amount of
equity (0-10% tranche).”2537

2536

In addition, on January 10, 2007, a few days after ACA was first approached by Goldman

about working on the Abacus CDO, Mr. Tourre sent ACA a “Transaction Summary” describing the
proposed transaction.  The Transaction Summary identified the Paulson hedge fund as the
“Transaction Sponsor,” described the “Contemplated Capital Structure” of the CDO, and indicated
that the lowest tranche, “[0]%-[9]%,” was “pre-committed first loss.”
Director told the Subcommittee that the “[0]%-[9]%” tranche identified in the Transaction

When asked about the Transaction Summary description of the lowest tranche in the Abacus

CDO, Mr. Tourre told the Subcommittee that the phrase “pre-committed first loss” normally
indicated that the tranche had been sold.  He stated that he actually meant to communicate that the
tranche had not been sold, and that portion of the Transaction Summary was poorly worded.2543

In his prepared statement at the Subcommittee hearing, Mr. Tourre testified that he never

told ACA that the Paulson hedge fund would be a long investor in the Abacus CDO:

“I never told ACA, the portfolio selection agent, that Paulson and Company would be an
equity investor in the AC-1 transaction or would take any long position in the deal. Although
I don’t recall the exact words that I used, I recall informing ACA that Paulson’s fund was
expected to buy credit protection on some of the senior tranches in this deal. This necessarily
meant that Paulson was expected to take some short position in the transaction.”

2544

 

In addition, Mr. Tourre testified that he informed ACA that the Paulson hedge fund was

going to invest only on the short side of the transaction:

Senator Levin:  You did not disclose to ACA that Paulson was on the short side of this deal. 
Is that correct?

Mr. Tourre:  I did mention to ACA that the expectation was that Paulson was going to buy
protection on senior layers of risk in the transaction.

Senator Levin:  That they were going to be only on the short side.

ACA has since filed a civil lawsuit against Goldman asserting that Goldman did not inform ACA
that “Paulson intended to take an enormous short position” in Abacus and is seeking to recover $30
million in compensatory damages and $90 million in punitive damages for fraudulent inducement,
fraudulent concealment, and unjust enrichment.2546

Regardless of the communications between Goldman and ACA, it is clear that the Abacus 

marketing material and offering documents provided by Goldman to investors contained no mention
of Paulson’s short position in the CDO nor the significant role it played in the selection of the
CDO’s reference assets.  This was confirmed by Mr. Tourre at the Subcommittee hearing:

Senator Levin:  And was it reflected in the Goldman Sachs security offering to investors that
Paulson had been part of the selection process?  Was that represented in that document?

Mr. Tourre:  Paulson was not disclosed in the Abacus 07 AC-1 transaction, Mr. Chairman.

Senator Levin:  It was not?

Mr. Tourre:  No, it was not.

2547

 

Still another troubling omission was Goldman’s failure to advise potential Abacus investors
that the firm’s own economic interests were aligned with those of the Paulson hedge fund.  As part
of the Abacus CDO arrangement, Paulson agreed to pay Goldman a higher fee if Goldman could

problem with the fee incentive offer was that, while lower premiums would result in lower costs to
Paulson, it would also result in lower premium payments to the CDO, directly reducing the amount
of cash available to the long investors.  The Paulson-Goldman compensation arrangement, thus,
created a direct conflict of interest between Goldman and the investors to whom it was selling the
Abacus securities.

Selling Abacus Securities.  Abacus 2007-AC1 closed, and its securities were issued on

April 26, 2007.  They were issued later than the securities from the Hudson, Anderson, and
Timberwolf CDOs and hit the market as subprime mortgages were hitting record delinquency and
default rates.  Goldman sold the Abacus 2007-AC1 securities to just three investors:  IKB, the
German bank; ACA, the portfolio selection agent; and ACA Financial Guaranty Corp., the owner of
ACA and a wholly owned subsidiary of ACA Capital Holdings Inc.
  IKB bought $150 million of
the AAA rated Abacus securities.  ACA bought about $42 million in the AAA securities for
placement in another CDO it was managing.

Shortly before the Abacus 2007-AC1 transaction closed, Goldman agreed to take the long side of a CDS
contract on the performance of a small portion of Abacus’ underlying assets when Paulson wanted to increase its
short position at the last minute.  Although Goldman ended up retaining this long investment, it did so only because
it could not find an investor who would buy it.  Mr. Tourre admitted this fact in the April 27, 2010 Subcommittee
Hearing.

Senator Levin:  Did Goldman intend to keep a long stake in that transaction when the deal was structured?  I
know it ended up with a piece.  Was it intended that it end up with a piece of that deal?

Senator Levin:  So it was intended to sell that piece?
Mr. Tourre:  For prudent risk management reasons, we were trying –  
Senator Levin:  Oh, I am sure for all the right reasons.  But it was intended that Goldman not have any long
stake on that piece.  Is that correct?
Mr. Tourre:  Yes.

Analysis.  Goldman constructed Abacus 2007-AC1 to help a hedge fund short multiple

RMBS securities.  Goldman allowed the hedge fund to play a significant role in the selection of the
CDO’s referenced assets, while employing an outside portfolio agent to give the impression that the
CDO assets were selected by a disinterested third party.  Goldman failed to disclose the hedge
fund’s investment objective and asset selection role to a credit rating agency that assigned AAA
ratings to two tranches of the Abacus securities.  Goldman also failed to provide full disclosure to
the long investors to whom it sold the Abacus securities.  In addition, Goldman failed to disclose to
the investors a compensation arrangement that provided incentives for Goldman to minimize the
premium payments into the CDO.  Within six months, the Abacus securities began incurring losses
and ratings downgrades.  Goldman watched the long investors to whom it had sold the securities
lose virtually all the funds they had invested, while the hedge fund it had assisted walked away with
a profit of approximately $1 billion.

sale of CDO securities, Goldman at times allowed conflicts of interest to affect how it carried out

liquidation agent in Hudson 1 and the collateral put provider in Timberwolf, illustrate the problems. 
In both cases, Goldman used its administrative roles to promote and enhance its own financial
interests at the expense of the clients to whom it had sold the CDO securities.

  Two examples, in which Goldman acted as the

AA.  Liquidation Agent in Hudson 1

In 2006 and 2007, several Goldman CDOs included provisions establishing a “liquidation

agent” to sell any poorly performing assets in the CDO.  This feature appeared in Hudson
Mezzanine 2006-1, which is examined in this Report, as well as Hout Bay 2006-1, Hudson High

during the Subcommittee hearing if “a non-biased person [could] look at the facts [of Abacus 2007-AC1] as you see
them and say there is a question of unethical behavior here,” David Viniar, the executive vice present and chief
financial officer for Goldman, stated he “didn’t believe so.”  April 27, 2010 Subcommittee Hearing at 125.

  Some of the administrative roles that Goldman filled in its CDOs, as described in its CDO agreements, included:

Agent, Calculation Agent under U.S. Dollar Cash Flow Swap Transaction, Collateral Put Provider, CP Note

Grade 2006-1, Hudson Mezzanine 2006-2, and Anderson Mezzanine 2007-1.
  In each instance,
Goldman served as the initial liquidation agent, although in several CDOs, it later transferred the
role to a third party.  In Hudson 1, Goldman’s dual roles as liquidation agent and sole short party in
the CDO created a direct conflict of interest between Goldman and the clients to whom it sold the
Hudson securities, which Goldman exploited by placing its own financial interests ahead of those of
its clients.

2562

2563

2564

Designing the Liquidation Agent Role.  According to Goldman, appointing a CDO
liquidation agent was a “fairly novel idea” that was first implemented in the 2006 Hout Bay
CDO.
  Peter Ostrem, then head of the CDO Origination Desk, oversaw the drafting of the
liquidation agent feature.
  He told the Subcommittee that Goldman wanted to issue static
portfolio CDOs, meaning CDOs whose assets did not change over time, but also wanted to protect
investors from poorly performing assets.  He explained that the liquidation agent feature was
intended to be triggered by a specified event and provided the liquidation agent with “no discretion”
other than to sell the poorly performing asset, which was referred to as a “Credit Risk Asset.”  He
explained that, without such a feature, poorly performing assets would “just stay there” in a CDO,
further harming investors.
could be performed by Goldman itself at a lower cost than retaining a traditional collateral
manager.

  The CDO Origination Desk also favored the approach, because it

    

2565

2566

The liquidation agent provisions established criteria for identifying “Credit Risk Assets” and

removing them from the CDO.  In a July 2006 memorandum to the Goldman Mortgage Capital
Committee, the CDO Origination Desk described the liquidation agent role as follows:

“As Liquidation Agent, Goldman will liquidate assets determined by the Trustee to be
‘Credit Risk Assets’ based on specific guidelines.  Goldman will have 12 months to sell
these assets.  Sales will be made under a competitive bidding process, whereby we will
solicit three outside bids and select the highest.  Prior to executing Hout Bay 1, in which we
also played the Liquidation Agent role, we spoke to multiple counterparties as to our role as
Liquidation Agent.  We received approval for our role in this transaction from legal and
accounting. ...  Finally, we spoke with outside counsel, Wilmer Cutler, about potential issues
related to the Investment Advisor Act.  They are of the opinion that our role of Liquidation
Agent does not cause us to be deemed an Investment Advisor based on the exception to the
Advisors Act for a ‘limited grant of discretion.’”2567

One key issue discussed in the memorandum was whether, by assuming the role of
liquidation agent, Goldman would trigger registration and disclosure obligations under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The CDO Origination Desk wrote:

“We have discussed Goldman’s role as Liquidation Agent internally with Tim Saunders
[counsel in Goldman’s legal department] and externally with outside counsel, Wilmer
Cutler.  One concern about that role was whether Goldman would be viewed as an
Investment Advisor.  We specifically crafted Goldman’s role in Hout Bay 1 and in this case
to eliminate both internal and external counsel’s concern about Goldman being treated as an
Investment Advisor.  The main factors that made Tim Saunders and Wilmer Cutler
comfortable that Goldman will not be treated as an Investment Advisor were:

- Goldman’s role is Liquidation Agent and not Collateral Manager.  Goldman is
engaged by the CDO to liquidate Credit Risk Assets and will receive an ongoing
Liquidation Agent Fee for such services; 

- Goldman does not determine whether an asset is a Credit Risk Asset.  Such
determination is made by the CDO based on specific rules . . . ;

- Goldman must liquidate such Credit Risk Assets within 12 months of such
determination and the price received on such liquidation must be in the context of a
three-bid process;

- Goldman does not receive additional compensation and or control of the CDO for
acting as a Liquidation Agent.  ... 

We will build a provision in the deal documents to allow Goldman to resign as Liquidation
Agent if appropriate notice is given and a replacement Liquidation Agent is in place.”2568

This memorandum indicates that, from its inception, the liquidation agent function was designed as
a narrow, ministerial role, in part to avoid the legal obligations applicable under federal law to
investment advisers.

The memorandum also indicated that “Credit Risk Assets” would be identified through

objective criteria.  For example, in the CDO under review, the memorandum stated that Credit Risk
Assets would be defined as “[a]ny asset that is downgraded by Moody’s or S&P below Ba2” and
“[a]ny asset that is defaulted.”

2569

 

Credit Rating Downgrades.  One year later, on July 19, 2007, after Mr. Ostrem had left

Goldman and Mr. Lehman had assumed responsibility for all Goldman-originated CDOs, he held a
conference call with members of the CDO team and Goldman in-house legal counsel Tim Saunders,

2568
2569

  Id.
  Id.

577

to discuss how to carry out Goldman’s CDO liquidation agent responsibilities.  The prior week,
Moody’s and S&P had suddenly downgraded hundreds of RMBS and CDO securities in the first of
many mass downgrades.  Those downgrades suddenly caused a number of assets in Goldman’s
CDOs to qualify as Credit Risk Assets that had to be liquidated.

In advance of the conference call, Mr. Lehman’s staff prepared a two-page summary of

Goldman’s liquidation agent duties, the liquidation procedures specified in the CDO documents, the
CDOs affected, and the assets that Goldman anticipated would be affected by the downgrades.

2570

 

Four days after the conference call, on July 23, 2007, Benjamin Case, who had been

assigned lead responsibility for carrying out Goldman’s liquidation agent functions, circulated a
draft document describing Goldman’s role.  It stated that Goldman’s goal as liquidation agent was:

“to attempt to maximize proceeds on the unwind of credit risk assets pursuant to the
liquidation process governed by the CDO documents, rather than to liquidate at an arbitrary
pre-specified time without regard to market conditions.”

   

2571

It identified the assets that had been classified as Credit Risk Assets and provided Goldman’s
“Current Strategy” for handling them:

“– wait and continue to evaluate market conditions, rather than liquidating now.
- upside is that continued short-covering by hedge funds anxious to monetize profits could
cause minor rally (5-10 points)[.]
- downside is that speed up of foreclosure process vs. current timeline expected by market
could decrease IO value, or significant forced selling of similar names by CDO vehicles
could push levels wider [lower prices].”

Hudson Liquidation Agent.  Although the liquidation agent role was originally designed 
for use in Goldman’s “high grade” CDOs, where “there is substantially less credit risk in the assets
vs. a mezzanine structured product CDO portfolio,” the feature was also added to some of its riskier
mezzanine CDOs, including Hudson Mezzanine 2007-1 (Hudson 1).
  Hudson 1 was a synthetic
CDO whose assets consisted entirely of CDS contracts referencing subprime RMBS or ABX assets
with BBB or BBB- ratings.  Goldman had selected 100% of the reference assets and held 100% of
the short side of the CDO.

2572

Hudson 1’s marketing materials outlined Goldman’s liquidation agent role.  The Hudson

marketing booklet, for example, told potential investors:

“Hudson CDOs are non-managed and static in nature and provide term non-recourse funding
where Goldman Sachs acts as Liquidation Agent on an ongoing basis.  The Liquidation
Agent will be responsible for efficiently selling credit risk assets.”

2573

  

The Hudson term sheet provided additional information about the liquidation agent role and the
“Credit Risk Assets” that would have to be liquidated:

 “Goldman as Liquidation Agent, will liquidate any asset determined to be a ‘credit risk’
within 12 months of said determination.  Credit Risk assets will include:  any asset
downgraded by Moody’s or S&P below Ba3 or BB-, any asset that is defaulted or would be
experiencing a credit event as defined by the PAUG [Pay As You Go] confirm.  There will
be no reinvestment, substitution, discretionary trading or discretionary sales.  After closing,
assets that are determined to be ‘credit risk’ securities will be sold by the Liquidation Agent
within one year of such determination.”

2574

  

The Hudson Offering Circular repeated that information and added:

“The Liquidation Agent will not have the right, or the obligation, to exercise any discretion
with respect to the method or the price of any assignment, termination or disposition of a
CDS Transaction; the sole obligation of the Liquidation Agent will be to execute such
assignment or termination of a CDS Transaction in accordance with the terms of the
Liquidation Agency Agreement. ...  [T]he Liquidation Agent shall have no responsibility for,
or liability relating to, the performance of the Issuer or any CDS Transaction, Reference
Obligation, Collateral Security or Eligible Investment.”2575

Goldman charged a 10 basis point ongoing fee for serving as the Hudson Liquidation Agent,2576
which resulted in its being paid a total fee of approximately $3.1 million.2577

While Goldman was marketing Hudson in 2007, a client asked why the liquidation agent

was “afforded up to 12 months to sell a credit risk asset.”
Goldman’s contemporaneous response, but when asked the same question, Darryl Herrick, the
Hudson deal captain, told the Subcommittee that there was “headline risk” associated with the
downgrade of an asset, and twelve months gave Goldman “flexibility to try to get a better price
later.”
against discretionary trading by the liquidation agent, Mr. Herrick said that Goldman had

In October 2007, Goldman began to contact Hudson investors to discuss transferring its

liquidation agent responsibilities to a third party.  That transfer required investor consent.  Benjamin
Case took notes of two telephone conversations he had with a Hudson investor, National Australia
Bank (NAB), discussing the issues.
  In the calls, Mr. Case explained why Goldman had yet to
liquidate any of the Credit Risk Assets, explaining that Goldman was waiting for asset prices to

changes to the Hudson deal.

  He also reported that Goldman was considering an amendment to the Hudson

    

2583

2585

2584

According to his notes, Mr. Case informed NAB that Goldman was seeking to transfer its

liquidation role to a third party with more liquidation experience, because that change: 

“will be in the best interest of investors – the credit obligation term was originally written
with the expectation that was unlikely to happen. ... 
Good for several reasons:
1.  Large institutional assets manager will be able to access more liquidity b/c [because] they
can access other broker dealers and get good pricing[.]

These notes indicate that, although Goldman was the architect of the Hudson CDO and selected
itself to serve as liquidation agent at a fee of $3.1 million, when Goldman was called upon to
execute its role, it believed the decision of when to liquidate the impaired assets “could be better
handled by an experienced manager.”

According to Mr. Case’s notes, NAB sent Mr. Case an email asking if Goldman held any of

the Hudson investments:  “does GS hold any of this?”  Mr. Case responded:

“def own equity and different pieces of various tranches no [sic] exactly, but decent size and
numbers of cl[a]sses on our books.”2587

Mr. Case apparently did not disclose that, in addition to its $6 million equity tranche, Goldman also
held 100% of the short position in the $2 billion CDO, and that its short investment would increase
in value as the Hudson assets lost value.

2588

According to Mr. Case’s notes, NAB replied by asking Goldman to provide more specific
information about Goldman’s holdings in the transaction:  “Could you please follow up with what
Goldman holds?”
  When Mr. Case asked why NAB wanted that information, NAB responded: 
“Want to make sure you [Goldman] are making restructuring decisions for the right reasons – make
sure serving the right interests.”  According to his notes, Mr. Case replied:  “Our intended goal of
liquidation agent is to serve the best interests of the CDO – that is the duty of the liquidation agent – 
it is a policy and process.”2589

In November 2007, Goldman took initial steps to transfer its liquidation agent

2590

2591

responsibilities to a third party.
  At that point, Goldman had yet to liquidate any of the Hudson
Credit Risk Assets.
  The nine assets that had become Credit Risks in July had already dropped
significantly in value.  One asset which, on July 16, had a value of 61% of its face (par) value, had
fallen by November 1 to 16% of par.
  Another asset that, on July 16, had a value of 43% of par,
had fallen in value by November 1 to 7% of par.

At the end of November, Goldman reached an agreement with Trust Company of the West
(TCW), subject to investor approval, in which Goldman would assign its liquidation agent duties to
TCW, and TCW would “share back” 30% of the fees with Goldman.
Subcommittee that Goldman’s decision to assign the liquidation agent rights to a third party was
because liquidation was a non core business for Goldman, and TCW was better suited to liquidate
the Credit Risk Assets.
approval to assign the liquidation agent role to TCW, a Goldman representative explained to an
investor the firm’s thinking:

  Mr. Lehman told the

2595

“GS [Goldman Sachs] is soliciting consent to assign GS role as liquidation agent to TCW
bec[ause] when liquidation agent role was designed, it was very ‘out of the money’; now
when the risk is very real, it is much more efficient to have a sophisticated collateral
manager bec[ause]
(i) TCW can access better liquidity than GS, ie get bids from the entire street
(ii) real asset manager can pursue further amendments to the doc to make liquidation more
efficient bec[ause] is not an asset [manager] under the investment act in 1940 and cannot act

On December 19, 2007,  Morgan Stanley, the largest Hudson long investor with a $1.2

billion interest encompassing the entire super-senior tranche,

declined to consent to the transfer, because the liquidation agent role was ministerial, had no
discretionary authority, and could quickly and easily be accomplished by Goldman.
Stanley told the Subcommittee that it instead asked Goldman to begin liquidating the $596.5 million
in Credit Risk Assets immediately, some of which had been designated as Credit Risks for five
months, and all of which had declined in value.2600

 On January 3, 2008, Daniel Sparks, the Mortgage Department head, was given a

spreadsheet listing the Credit Risk Assets in each of the CDOs in which Goldman was serving as
the liquidation agent, including Hudson 1.  The spreadsheet showed that, in Hudson, 44 assets were
Credit Risks with a face value of $635 million, totaling about 30% of the asset pool.

The spreadsheet also showed that the weighted average values of the Hudson assets had fallen
dramatically, causing losses that could have been avoided had Goldman liquidated them sooner. 
The weighted average values had fallen from 45% of face (par) value in July, to a low of 15% on
November 1, 2007, and were about 20% of par value on January 2, 2008.

Hudson Conflict of Interest.  Despite the falling values and Morgan Stanley’s ongoing

request to initiate liquidation of the Credit Risk Assets as set out in the Hudson 1 agreement,
Goldman still did not begin liquidating.  

During January and February 2008, Morgan Stanley engaged in frequent communications
with Goldman personnel, including Mr. Lehman who oversaw Goldman’s CDOs, and Mr. Case
who oversaw the liquidation agent function, to initiate liquidation of the Hudson assets.
  The
falling value of the Hudson assets caused sharp losses in Morgan Stanley’s $1.2 billion investment,
leading Morgan Stanley to press for the Credit Risk Assets to be liquidated and removed from the
CDO as soon as possible.  In contrast, as the Hudson assets fell in value, Goldman, as the CDO’s
sole short party, saw its short position become increasingly profitable.  Goldman had little financial
incentive to liquidate the Credit Risk Assets, because the more they fell in value, the more Goldman
was able to maximize the profits from its short position in the CDO.  Goldman’s dual roles as
liquidation agent and short party, thus, created a conflict of interest that disadvantaged the long
investors in the Hudson CDO, such as Morgan Stanley.2604

Morgan Stanley personnel expressed increasing frustration with Goldman’s failure to
liquidate the Hudson Credit Risk Assets, in both internal communications and with Goldman
representatives.  On January 16, 2008, for example, the key trader on Morgan Stanley’s Proprietary
Trading Desk dealing with Hudson wrote to a colleague:  “Had another call with [Goldman’s] sr.
trader about GS’s liquidation agent role in the $1.2bn HUDSON deal.  They insist they are NOT
acting as a fiduciary per the docs in this deal.”
  On February 5, he sent Mr. Lehman an email: 
“[P]lease call when possible – $969mm now eligible to be liquidated post S&P do[w]ngrades.”
2606

2605

  

On February 6, the Morgan Stanley trader wrote to a colleague: 

“[W]ent down the road with Goldman on liquidation agent assets (now ~$1bb of eligible
assets post downgrades).  They told me they will ‘continue to take my opinion under
advisement’ but provided no course of action.  I broke my phone.  Will talk to [Morgan
Stanley legal counsel] tomorrow but don’t think there is any probable way for us to force
them to liquidate assets.”

2607

  

On February 7, the Morgan Stanley trader sent another email to Mr. Lehman:

“Spoke with Ben [Case] re: Hudson today.
Goes without saying I remain very frustrated by the way GS is handling the liquidation agent
role.  There is almost $1bb of eligible assets in that deal now, every one of which has lost
value since it was downgraded. 
No good reason to wait other th[a]n to devalue our position.  It’s a shame .... [O]ne day I
hope I get the real reason why you are doing this to me.”2608

According to Morgan Stanley, Goldman continued to explain its seven-month delay in

liquidating the Credit Risk Assets by asserting that the market would rebound during a rally to cover
shorts, and it should wait to liquidate until asset prices rose.  In a February 13, 2008 telephone call
between Morgan Stanley and Goldman, for example, which was recorded and transcribed, Mr. Case
stated:

“So I think, as we see the short covering wave kind of continue to proceed ... it’s gonna get
to the point where it’s in the best interest of the deal to start liquidating then. ...  I know
we’ve talked about this twelve month period ... it doesn’t seem like it’s gonna take till late in
the twelve month process for the majority of these assets to get to that point.”2609

Morgan Stanley asked if there was anything beyond the “technical nature of the markets,” such as
government intervention, to produce “any kind of real pop” that would improve the underlying

fundamentals in the mortgage market.  Mr. Case responded:  “The chance that it could move in that
direction, at least in the next few months . . . is de minimis I’d say.”
Stanley’s representative again urged Goldman to begin the liquidation process:  “Just so you know,
my opinion stays the same, I’d like to see a bid list before three o’clock today.”2611

  During the call, Morgan

2610

Morgan Stanley told the Subcommittee that the Hudson assets had been in near continuous

decline, and Goldman’s refusal to liquidate assets shortly after they became Credit Risk Assets
allowed them to decline further, rather than limiting losses for bondholders.  By February 21, 2008,
Morgan Stanley had calculated that the liquidation delay had cost it $130.5 million; the next week it
calculated the losses had increased to $150 million.

2612

  

Morgan Stanley told Goldman that by delaying the liquidation of the Credit Risk Assets,

Goldman was in violation of the terms in the Hudson 1 offering circular, in particular the provision: 
“The Liquidation Agent will not have the right, or the obligation, to exercise any discretion with
respect to the method or the price of any assignment, termination or disposition of a ... Credit Risk
Obligation.”
immediately initiate liquidation of $1 billion in Hudson Credit Risk Assets:

  On February 29, 2008, Morgan Stanley sent Goldman a letter demanding that it

2613

“As Liquidation Agent, [Goldman] is currently responsible for liquidating approximately
$1,000,000,000 of Credit Risk Obligations.  The transaction documents clearly state that
[Goldman] would not exercise investment discretion in its role as Liquidation Agent.
[Goldman] has not yet liquidated a single Credit Risk Obligation, notwithstanding that some
date back to August of 2007.  The [Goldman] employee handling the liquidation has
explained this by stating that he believes the price for these obligations will increase in the
future and it is better for the deal to liquidate these obligations at a later date. ...

The Liquidation Agency Agreement states that “the Liquidation Agent ... shall not provide
investment advisory services to the Issuer or act as the “collateral manager” for the
Pledged Assets. ...

While the Liquidation Agency Agreement provides that the Liquidation Agent must
complete the process of liquidating the relevant assets within twelve months, it does not
provide the Liquidation Agent with any right to delay the liquidation process based on the
exercise of Investment discretion.  To the contrary, the Liquidation Agency Agreement and
the [Offering Circular] clearly state that no discretion or investment advisory services are
ever to be provided by the Liquidation Agent.”2614

Morgan Stanley concluded by “demanding only that [Goldman] fulfill its contractual duties as
required by the Liquidation Agency Agreement and assign, terminate or otherwise dispose of the
relevant CDS transaction forthwith.”

On March 10, 2008, Goldman responded:

“[Y]our letter is entirely mistaken in its suggestion that Goldman Sachs has somehow
breached its obligations under the Liquidation Agency Agreement.  As [Morgan Stanley’s]
letter recognizes, Section 2(b) of the Liquidation Agency Agreement specifically provides
that Goldman, acting as Liquidation Agent, has up to twelve months in which to assign,
terminate or otherwise dispose of Credit Risk Obligations assigned to it for that purpose. 
Obviously, establishment of a liquidation period of that duration contemplates – and, indeed,
embodies Hudson’s informed consent – that the Liquidation Agent will necessarily exercise
judgement in determining when and how to dispose of Credit Risk Obligations assigned to it
for that purpose. ...

Nor does this expressly intended contractual latitude transform Goldman Sachs into a de
facto ‘investment adviser’ to Hudson, as you suggest.  The Agreement ... in fact
categorically disclaims that Goldman Sachs or its affiliates will be providing investment
advisory services or otherwise acting as an adviser or fiduciary to Hudson by virtue of its
liquidation services.  That disclaimer is perfectly consistent with discretion routinely
accorded to securities brokers in seeking to fulfill their obligation to obtain the best
execution possible for their clients without making them ‘investment advisors.’”
2615

 

Several days before Goldman’s response letter was sent to Morgan Stanley, however,
Goldman began liquidating the Credit Risk Assets in Hudson 1.  On March 7, 2008, Goldman
liquidated eight assets, followed by more on March 20 and 28, liquidating nearly one third of the
eligible assets over the course of the month.
  In its role as liquidation agent, Goldman was
required to solicit bids from at least three independent dealers for the Credit Risk Assets, and
Morgan Stanley was given an opportunity to bid on many of the liquidated assets.

Analysis.  In several of the CDOs it constructed, Goldman established a new position of

liquidation agent and appointed itself to play that role for a substantial fee.  In the case of Hudson 1,
by taking on the role of liquidation agent at the same time it was the sole short party in the CDO,
Goldman created a conflict of interest.  When the Hudson 1 assets began falling in value, the long
investors wanted the poorly performing assets liquidated as soon as possible; Goldman, on the other
hand, benefitted financially the farther the assets fell in value since that allowed Goldman to
maximize the value of its short position. 

Goldman delayed liquidating the Credit Risk Assets, despite urgent requests from the largest
Hudson investor, Morgan Stanley, placing its own financial interests ahead of the client to whom it
had sold a $1.2 billion Hudson investment.  

BB.  Collateral Put Provider in Timberwolf 

The second example of a conflict of interest affecting how Goldman carried out a CDO
administrative function involves Goldman’s role as the collateral put provider in Timberwolf I. 
Synthetic CDOs like Timberwolf collected cash from the long investors that purchased its securities
as well as from the short parties that paid CDS premiums to the CDO.  A portion of the cash
collected from the long investors was placed by the CDO into a “default swap collateral account” to
be used if the CDO performed poorly and payments had to be made to the short parties.
  At one
time, many CDOs used the cash in the default swap collateral account to purchase Guaranteed
Investment Contracts (GICs), which guaranteed repayment of the principal and a fixed or floating
interest rate for a fixed period of time.  But in the years leading up to the financial crisis, CDO
issuers sought to use the cash in the default swap collateral account to make investments that
generated higher returns, in order to improve financial performance, obtain better credit ratings, and
attract investors.  To obtain those higher returns, CDO issuers began to invest the incoming cash in
“default swap collateral securities.”   

2620

Goldman’s synthetic CDOs generally invested in default swap collateral securities, and its
CDO agreements typically set out parameters for the types of default swap collateral securities that
could be purchased with investor funds, often requiring them to be high quality, low risk, liquid

2619

2620
  The amount of assets in the default swap collateral account was required to equal the total face (“notional”)
value of the CDS entered into by the CDO.  This arrangement provided assurance to the short parties that funds
would be available if and when payments were due to them under the CDS.  CDO agreements often required that the
cash placed in the default swap collateral account be kept in very secure, short term, cash-like instruments such as
Treasury notes or Certificates of Deposit (called “Eligible Investments”) until the cash was used to acquire default
swap collateral or make payments to a short party.  If any credit event resulted in payments from the default swap
collateral account to the short parties under the CDS contracts, the long parties might not receive all of their principal
investment at the maturity of the deal.

investments.
  If the CDO had a collateral manager, the manager often selected the CDO’s default
swap collateral securities.  The returns earned by the default swap collateral securities often became
an important component of the CDO’s income.  The principal proceeds of the default swap
collateral securities were typically re-invested in similar securities until the CDO matured or the
proceeds were needed to make payments to short parties.   

Goldman’s Dual Roles.  In its synthetic CDOs, Goldman often took on two roles that

2622

 and its collateral put provider.  Goldman’s synthetic CDOs typically followed

affected the default swap collateral securities, acting as both the CDO’s primary CDS
counterparty
industry practice by making one entity the sole counterparty for all of the CDS contracts issued by
the CDO.  In Goldman CDOs, that party was generally Goldman Sachs International (GSI), a
United Kingdom subsidiary that was wholly owned by Goldman.  Typically, GSI was the sole party
that entered into a CDS contract directly with the domestic and offshore companies that served as
the issuers of the CDO’s securities (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Issuer”).
then acted as an intermediary for the Issuer by entering into a corresponding CDS contract with each
party seeking to take a short position in the CDO.  By inserting itself into the middle of the CDS
transactions, GSI put Goldman’s financial standing behind the CDS contracts issued by the Issuer
and improved the credit ratings assigned to and investor confidence in the CDO.  If a credit event
later took place, the Issuer was responsible for making payments to GSI, and GSI, whether or not it
received sufficient payments from the Issuer, was responsible for making the payments owed to the
short parties in the corresponding CDS contracts.  Sometimes, instead of contracting with a third
party, GSI kept some or all of the short positions in the CDO on behalf of Goldman itself.

   GSI

2623

 By acting as the primary CDS counterparty, GSI necessarily took the short side of each
CDS contract it entered into with the Issuer.  Those CDS contracts typically provided that, in the
event of a specified credit event that required payment to GSI, GSI could collect a specified amount
of funds from the Issuer.  The Issuer paid its obligations to GSI by first drawing down any available
cash in the default swap collateral account.  If that cash was insufficient, GSI also had the right to
identify one or more of the default swap collateral securities that together had a face (par) value
equal to the amount owed to GSI.  Those securities could then be sold and the sale proceeds used to

  The parameters governing the type of default swap collateral securities that could be purchased with investor

2621
funds were generally outlined in the CDO agreement documents and offering memorandum.  Typical criteria
included:  a AAA credit rating; a yield slightly greater than LIBOR; limitations on the maturation dates of the
securities; and limited exposure to a single counterparty.  Generally, the CDO agreement required that some of the
default swap collateral be retained in Eligible Investments in order be able to fulfill any obligations or payments due
in the short term.  In CDOs reviewed by the Subcommittee, the default collateral securities were sometimes RMBS
or CDO securities bearing AAA ratings.  These securities often lost substantial value which the collateral put
provider then had to absorb.

2623
  Typically a shell company incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction (often the Cayman Islands) and a shell company
incorporated in the United States (often Delaware) served as the “Issuer” and “Co-Issuer,” respectively of the CDO.
Generally, the financial institution that was underwriting the CDO, in this case Goldman, would arrange for the
establishment of those entities.  For simplicity, this section will refer to both companies as the “Issuer” of the CDO
securities. 

  The Timberwolf Indenture agreement referred to this role as the “Synthetic Security Counterparty.”  See

received from the sale proceeds to pay off the short parties in the corresponding CDS contracts. 
Since GSI’s financial obligations under the CDS contracts were dependent in part upon the quality
of the default swap collateral securities, Goldman provided in the CDO agreement that those
securities could be purchased only with the prior “consent” of GSI.  This arrangement enabled
Goldman to exert control over the selection of the default swap collateral securities.  

  GSI would then use the cash it

2624

In addition to acting as the primary CDS counterparty in the CDOs it constructed, Goldman
often acted as the CDO’s default swap collateral put provider (hereinafter “collateral put provider”). 
The collateral put provider essentially guarantees the face (par) value of the CDO’s default swap
collateral securities.2625

Since GSI was already acting as the primary CDS counterparty, the CDO indenture

agreement typically provided that, if the market value of any default collateral security selected by
GSI to satisfy an amount owed to GSI fell below its face (par) value, then GSI suffered the market
risk, and could not recover additional funds from the Issuer to make up for the security’s loss in
value.  GSI was still responsible, however, for making full payments to the short parties in the
corresponding CDS contracts.  This arrangement functioned effectively as a “put” agreement that
guaranteed the face (par) value of the default swap collateral securities, and Goldman treated the
arrangement as a put agreement.  

Due to the dual roles played by GSI in its CDOs, many of Goldman’s CDO indenture

agreements did not contain an explicit put agreement, but simply constructed GSI’s CDS contracts
to include the provisions that achieved the same result.  For example, the Timberwolf Indenture
agreement specified that the primary CDS counterparty in its CDS contract – GSI – bore the market
risk associated with any default swap collateral sold to satisfy an obligation to that counterparty.
 
2626
In exchange for bearing the risk of not receiving the full payment owed to it from the sale of the
default swap collateral securities, GSI received a discount – typically equal to 5 basis points – on
the premiums GSI paid to the Issuer under the primary CDS contract.  In a CDO deal of $1 billion,
the premium discount would yield a “fee” of approximately $500,000.
  In most cases, however,

2627

  Another option was for Goldman to take physical possession of the security. 
  In a typical put agreement, the put provider guarantees to pay to the put purchaser the face (par) value of a

2624
2625
specified security upon delivery of the security, or pay to the put purchaser the difference between the security’s par
value and actual market price when sold.  In exchange for that protection, the put purchaser typically pays a fee to
the put provider.  In many of the CDS contracts associated with synthetic CDOs, as described above, GSI fulfilled
the role of a put provider, by absorbing any shortfall between the face (par) value and market price of any default
swap collateral securities sold to pay amounts owing to the short party in the CDS contract. 
2626
accounting purposes, Goldman established a CDO Put Reserve, to account for potential losses that might result from
its role as a collateral put provider in CDOs. 
2627
  Any subsequent losses resulting from Goldman’s role as the collateral put provider would reduce the profit
resulting from that fee.  In responses to Subcommittee questions for the record regarding 7 CDOs (Fort Denison,
Camber 7, Timberwolf, Anderson Mezzanine, Point Pleasant, Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1, and Hudson Mezzanine
2006-2), Goldman reported that for most of the CDOs, the net profit was less than $500,000.  One exception was
Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1, which yielded a profit of approximately $1 million.  See Goldman response to

  See 3/27/2007 Timberwolf I, LTD. Indenture Agreement, at § 12.5(b), GS MBS-E-021825583 at 712.  For

591

the CDO indenture agreements did not specifically cite the connection between GSI’s bearing the
market risk of the default swap collateral sales and receiving a CDS premium discount.  The CDO
agreements simply included a reduced premium payment by GSI under the primary CDS contract
with the Issuer.

2628

 

Timberwolf Conflict of Interest.  In the Timberwolf CDO, GSI acted as both the primary
  
CDS counterparty and the collateral put provider.  Documents provided to the Subcommittee show
how these dual roles created a conflict between Goldman and the Timberwolf long investors, and
how Goldman reacted by placing its interests before those of the clients to whom it had sold the
Timberwolf securities. 
   

In 2007, as the mortgage market deteriorated, the value of many types of default swap
collateral securities also declined.  Goldman became concerned that if the market value of the
securities fell below par and a credit event occurred, those securities would provide insufficient
funds to pay the amounts owed to GSI under its primary CDS contract with the Issuer.  In addition,
Goldman knew that the more the default swap collateral securities fell in value, the more of a
shortfall Goldman would have to make up if GSI had to make payments to other short parties. 
Goldman wanted to maximize the value of the default swap collateral and what would be available

Subcommittee QFR at PSI_QFR_GS0249.   For another CDO, Broadwick, Goldman also projected that the premium
discount would yield a profit of more than $1 million, less any costs it might have to absorb in its role as put
provider.  See 4/12/2006 email from Peter Ostrem to John Little and Robert Leventhal, GS MBS-E-010808964 at
66-67 (“Can we agree on how we want to treat P&L [profit and loss] on Peloton relative to the put swap?  We expect
P&L of over $1mm [million] for the 5bp [basis point] reduction in the CDS premiums. ...  I propose we separately
book the put swap at close to zero (contingent MTM risk on 2 yr AAA diversified portfolio where Goldman retains
selection optionality seems low), but we are open to booking 1bp in negative put cost (i.e., -$200k).”).  In some other
CDOs, the projected put fee was about $500,000. 
2628
1 and Point Pleasant, Goldman received a direct fee for acting as the collateral put provider.  Goldman
representatives told the Subcommittee that, because the put fee was “embedded” in the CDS agreement in some of
the CDOs, Goldman’s operations group sometimes overlooked and failed to “book” the profit and loss associated
with those put arrangements.  When this oversight was discovered in 2007, Goldman identified 18 CDO put
arrangements that had not been identified and accounted for in Goldman’s books.  See 6/28/2007 email from Carly
Scales to Phil Armstrong and Steve Schultz, GS MBS-E-015192547: 

  Timberwolf used this reduced premium approach, but in a few other instances, such as Hudson Mezzanine 2006-

- The Put option was embedded into the deal documents (Indenture, Offering Circular, etc – both of

- For these trades, an intermediation fee was being taken on the CDS trades, but no specific Put

employee on the CDO Origination Desk and the deal captain of the Timberwolf CDO, sent an email
to his colleagues requesting information on CDOs that Goldman had “significant exposure to in
terms of default swap collateral.”
  Mr. Bieber identified 17 possible CDOs where the default
swap collateral securities may have lost value and stated:  “we need to get Dan [Sparks, the
Mortgage Department head,] a list this morning.”
the Subcommittee that he did not recall why he had sent it or why he had to deliver the list to Mr.
Sparks that same day, but he said he did recall that the decline in the value of the default swap
securities was an issue.
  In response to the email, Goldman employees associated with the
various CDOs submitted lists of the existing default swap collateral securities with their par and
market values. 

  When asked about this email, Mr. Bieber told

2631

2632

As the mortgage market worsened, Goldman’s attention to the value of the default collateral
securities increased.  On July 18, 2007, the Goldman Credit Department sent an email to Mr. Bieber
indicating that Goldman had large, valuable short positions in six of the CDOs it had originated, but
that the department needed to monitor the value of the default swap collateral securities in each
CDO to understand Goldman’s “exposure” under the CDS contracts:

“From our discussion earlier today, we were able to verify the MTM [mark to market]
exposures on the below CDOs against what we have in our credit systems (they are in fact as
large as we mentioned).  Our next step is understanding how the collateral pools are
performing in each of the deals.  Would you be able to give us a summary of the current
marks and default writedowns for the below deals?  This would help us in monitoring the
collateralization in relation to our exposure from CDS.”

    

2633

The next day, July 19, 2007, Mr. Bieber informed David Lehman, who then oversaw

Goldman’s CDOs, that the Credit Department had asked the ABS Desk in the Mortgage Department
to “mark” the value of all of the default swap collateral securities in the Goldman-originated CDOs

  One reason Goldman was so concerned about the value of the default swap collateral securities was because

to “get a sense of the MV [market value] supporting the deals[’] obligation to pay us, if
necessary.”

2634

  

Later that same day, another Credit Department official sent an email message to Mr.

Lehman similar to the one that had been sent to Mr. Bieber:

“We understand that you are responsible for marking the collateral in relation to the below
CDOs.  Is that true?  If so, can you please put us on your distribution list for these.  We have
some sizeable in the money swap positions (i.e. cdo owes GS) and Credit needs to monitor
these positions vs. collateral market value.”2635

 

With respect to Timberwolf, on July 25, 2007, Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman employee on the
Mortgage Department’s Correlation Trading Desk, circulated an internal Goldman analysis showing
that the weighted average value or “mark” of Timberwolf’s default swap collateral securities had
declined over 3%.
Mr. Tourre suggested to his colleagues that as Timberwolf’s default swap collateral securities
matured, the resulting cash proceeds should not be re-invested in new securities, but instead be
retained as cash:

  During the same period, the value of Goldman’s short position had increased. 

2636

“We need to start monitoring MtM [mark to market value] of the CDS collateral for the
Wolf, given how much in the money the CDS are - right now, average bid side for the AAA
cash bonds is approx 96.89 - per Mahesh analysis below.   Matt/Mehesh - maybe we should
look at the collateral reinvestment provisions in this deal - ideally principal proceeds on the
CDS collateral should not be reinvested but I guess Greywolfe [sic] has discretion on this,
right?”2637

In response, Mr. Bieber noted that the same situation applied to all of Goldman’s CDOs; the
declining value of the default swap collateral securities was increasing Goldman’s exposure, and a
weekly monitoring program was being set up.  He also noted that it would be difficult for Goldman
to oppose re-investment of the cash proceeds from maturing securities across the board:

“CDS across all of our transactions are in the money.  We’ve had conversations at length
with credit regarding our exposure to the default swap collateral and are setting ourselves up
for weekly monitoring/pricing of the default swap collateral across the cdo business. 

“We have discretionary approval over default swap collateral, however, it will be difficult
for us to take the non-reinvestment approach.”2638

The next day, on July 26, 2007, the collateral manager of one of Goldman’s CDOs sought

approval to purchase some new default swap collateral securities.  A Goldman employee responded: 
“We are going to pass on this bond.  Given current market conditions, we’d like to keep some cash
in the default swap collateral.”
  A few days later, after receiving more requests to approve the
purchase of new default swap collateral securities, Mr. Bieber asked Mr. Lehman for a meeting to
discuss how to proceed:

2639

“Have gotten several requests today for reinvestment (Greywolf on TWOLF and TCW on
DS7 [Davis Square 7]).  Would like to sit down this evening to discuss how we’re going to
respond as this comes up.”

   

2640

In early August, Goldman conducted an internal analysis to assess the decrease in the return
 
to the CDOs if the default swap collateral was kept in cash rather than re-invested in securities.
2641
As expected, that analysis showed that using the cash in the default swap collateral account to buy
new securities would yield a larger return and more money for the CDO investors.
  But buying
new securities also meant that Goldman, as the primary CDS counterparty and collateral put
provider, would bear the risk if those securities later declined in market value.  If the securities’
market value fell below their par value, but had to be sold to make payments to the CDOs’ short
parties, Goldman would have to absorb any shortfall in the course of making the required payments
to the short parties.  Goldman’s risk would be mitigated, however, if the default swap collateral was
kept in cash, since cash is not subject to the same market fluctuation.  The result was that Goldman
benefitted more if the CDO default swap collateral was kept in cash, but the CDO investors
benefitted more if the collateral was kept in securities.  In short, what was best for Goldman clashed
with what was best for the investors to whom Goldman had sold the Timberwolf securities.  

2642

Subsequent documents show that Goldman placed its financial interests before those of the

CDO investors by taking actions to keep the CDO default swap collateral in cash, rather than
securities.  On August 21, 2007, Mr. Bieber sent an email to Mr. Lehman asking about what
Goldman had decided regarding re-investment of the cash collateral:  “Was there any further
discussion over the past few days on what were going to be doing?  With the 25th coming up, I
suspect a bunch of managers are going to be looking to put cash to work.”
responded:  “Nothing further – I think our gameplan remains to build cash for now.”  Mr. Bieber
replied:  “Ok.  I think we should be proactive in letting managers know, then, rather than waiting for
them to come to us for approval and then denying.”  Mr. Lehman agreed.

the same securities could be obtained at a price lower than their par value, their yield (return on investment)
increased as long as they continued to meet their scheduled principal and interest payments. This was another
potential benefit to the long investors which conflicted with the interest of Goldman, the short party.

Greywolf Objections.  Over the next three or four weeks, Goldman continued to refuse to
consent to the purchase of new default swap collateral securities by the collateral managers of its
CDOs.

2644

 

At first, Goldman delayed telling Greywolf, Timberwolf’s collateral manager, what it had

decided.  In late August and early September, Joseph Marconi, a Greywolf executive, former
Goldman employee, and key member of the Greywolf team managing Timberwolf, sent Goldman
several requests to buy new default swap collateral securities, without receiving a response.  On
September 6, 2007, a Goldman employee on the CDO Origination Desk forwarded one of the
requests to Mr. Bieber with the comment:  “Guess we can’t delay talking to him anymore.”
2645
Bieber informed Mr. Marconi that Goldman would no longer approve the purchase of additional
default swap collateral securities for Timberwolf.  When informed of Goldman’s decision,
Mr. Marconi protested in an email to Mr. Lehman, who was Mr. Bieber’s supervisor:

  Mr.

“David:  I would like to have a call with you to discuss the purchase of Default Swap
Collateral into Timberwolf.  I understand you are traveling this week.  Let me know when
you will have some time to talk.  In response to the attached message, Matt [Bieber] told me
that GS will not approve the purchase of any additional Default Swap Collateral into
Timberwolf.  While GS does have consent rights regarding the purchase of Default Swap
Collateral, a blanket refusal to approve any assets is inappropriate, inconsistent with the
parties’ original expectations and will negatively impact the performance of both the debt
and equity issued by Timberwolf.  Give me a call when you can.”2646

 

When asked by Subcommittee what he meant when he wrote that “a blanket refusal to
approve any assets is inappropriate, inconsistent with the parties’ original expectations and will
negatively impact the performance of both the debt and equity issued by Timberwolf,” Mr. Marconi
explained that if Goldman wouldn’t approve any new purchases as the default swap collateral
securities matured, the CDO would have an increasing amount of cash on hand that would produce
less income for Timberwolf than if that cash were invested in new securities.

2647

 

Later on September 6, 2007, Mr. Lehman telephoned and spoke with Mr. Marconi.  Neither

he nor Mr. Marconi recalled exactly what was discussed, but the following day Mr. Marconi sent
Mr. Lehman an email that repeated Greywolf’s objections to Goldman’s decision not to consent to
the purchase of new default swap collateral securities:

  See 9/21/2007 email from Marty Devote of Aladdin Capital Management to Benjamin Case, GS MBS-E

heard, you were re-evaluating the market, and would come back to us with a breakdown of acceptable replacements. 
As the cash balances continue to grow, I’d like to address this issue, as the amount of cash drag is beginning to
become meaningful.”).

“David:  As we discussed yesterday, I believe that your refusal to approve the purchase of
any additional Default Swap Collateral into Timberwolf is unreasonable and inconsistent
with the way the transaction structure was originally presented to us.  We were told that the
purpose of the approval rights was to permit GS to review specific assets and approve or
disapprove specific assets based on their relative credit merits.  If we thought for a second
that you had the right to prohibit all new purchases indefinitely, we would have
implemented the much simpler GIC [Guaranteed Investment Contract] structure that is used
in most other synthetic CDOs and CDO^2 transactions and thereby locked in a fixed spread
to LlBOR for the term of our transaction.  Also, the Timberwolf CDS economics include an
ongoing fee to GS for the put swap component of the trade; we would not have agreed to
those terms if we thought you had this option.  Finally, I believe that if anyone on the deal
team thought you had this option, it would have been clearly disclosed in the OM [Offering
Memorandum].  Especially given current market conditions, I am surprised that you are
taking a position that will directly result in less cash flow being available to debt and equity
investors.  As I said yesterday, we recognize the impact of current market conditions and,
even before I spoke with Matt, I was suggesting we collectively focus on shorter average life
AAA RMBS for the deal and I specifically solicited feedback on securities where GS would
be comfortable.  I continue to be surprised by your response.”2648

When asked by the Subcommittee why he sent such a strongly worded email to Goldman regarding
its refusal to approve the reinvestment of Timberwolf’s cash collateral, Mr. Marconi responded: 
“We felt strongly about this.  We had an obligation to investors to do the right thing.”2649

Mr. Marconi told the Subcommittee that Goldman had rationalized its decision by

contending that it was less risky to have more cash and fewer securities.  Mr. Marconi also told the
Subcommittee that Greywolf felt Goldman’s blanket refusal to approve the purchase of additional
securities was inconsistent with the terms of the CDO, and if anyone at Greywolf had believed that
Goldman possessed that authority, Greywolf would have structured the deal differently.
addition, Mr. Marconi’s September 6 email pointed out that Goldman was receiving an “ongoing
fee” to serve as the collateral put provider and undertake the risk of guaranteeing the par value of
the default swap collateral securities.  The email stated that Greywolf would not have agreed to pay
that fee to Goldman if it had thought Goldman could use its approval authority to stop the purchase
of all default swap collateral securities and mitigate the risk it was being paid to bear.

The exchanges between Greywolf and Goldman brought into question the proper

interpretation of Section 12.5 of the Timberwolf Indenture agreement which required the CDO to

deal documents impose any obligation on the Secured Party to consent to reinvestment of

Goldman’s internal documents show that on September 7, 2007, the day after the email

exchange between Mr. Marconi and Mr. Lehman, Mr. Bieber scheduled a meeting with Goldman’s
legal counsel and a key compliance officer to discuss the issue.  His email stated:

“Pls see email we received below – wanted to get your take on what response (if any) we
should craft.  This is related to the default swap collateral account in Timberwolf used to
collateralize the exposure we have to the CDO on the CDS contracts that are the assets in

it, the key participants said they could not recall whether the meeting took place, what was
discussed at the meeting if it did take place, or what determinations were reached regarding
Goldman’s authority or actions.  The participants who could not recall the meeting included Mr.
Bieber, the Timberwolf deal captain; Tim Saunders, counsel from Goldman’s legal department;
Susan Helfrick, another legal counsel; and Jordan Horvath, the compliance officer.  Mr. Saunders,
the lead Goldman legal counsel on the matter, informed the Subcommittee that he had “no present
recollection of the circumstances surrounding any disagreement between Goldman Sachs and
Greywolf Capital Management LP regarding Goldman Sachs’ right to consent to reinvestment of
default swap collateral in Timberwolf.”

type of default swap collateral securities that could be purchased for its CDOs.2658

  Mr. Bieber, the Timberwolf deal captain, told the

However, documents obtained by the Subcommittee indicate that the meeting did take place,
and Goldman did develop a strategy to respond to Greywolf’s concerns.  On September 7, 2007, the
same day as the meeting, Mr. Lehman sent a email to Mr. Bieber stating:

“U spoke w[ith] [Jonathan] egol?  What ab[ou]t legal/compliance[?]  Just make sure Dan

Mr. Bieber responded:  “Spoke with legal/compliance.  Not doing anything w/o [without]
discussing with dan [Sparks] first.  Agree with the point on consistency.”2660

Also on September 7, 2007, Jonathan Egol, head of the Mortgage Department’s Correlation

set of very safe asset backed securities that it could propose to Greywolf as possible default swap

Subcommittee that he generally recalled having discussions with his colleagues, including Goldman’s legal
department, about the general issue of default swap collateral, but did not recall his conversation with Mr. Marconi. 
He also submitted a statement to the Subcommittee saying he had no recollection of whether the meeting took place
or, if a meeting was held, what was discussed or decided.  Written statement of Mr. Lehman (1/26/2011).   Mr.

Subsequent documents indicate that Goldman reversed its initial position and decided to

consent to the purchase of more default swap collateral securities.  However, Goldman appeared to
narrow the class of asset backed securities that it would consent to be acquired as default swap
collateral.  On September 10, 2007, Mr. Bieber sent an email to Mr. Lehman reporting:
 

“Managed to catch up with Dan [Sparks] just now ... we’re going to put together a list of
SLMA floaters in our inventory to show Joe [Marconi at Greywolf].  Going over w/ Dan
tomorrow before sending anything externally.”

2663

 

Goldman also sent a short list of commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) in its inventory
that it would consent to be acquired for Timberwolf.
  

2664

 

Over the next two weeks, Goldman sent a list of acceptable securities to two more collateral

2665

managers of its CDOs.
  On October 15, 2007, Mr. Bieber provided virtually the same list to a
Goldman colleague together with a short explanation of some of the criteria used to identify the
securities:

2664
  9/25/2007 email from Matthew Bieber to Joe Marconi, GS MBS-E-000766338.  The action taken by Goldman
to stop the purchase of new default swap collateral securities was not the only instance in which it attempted to exert
control over the collateral in the CDOs it constructed.  In the case of the Broadwick CDO, for example, when some
investors were entitled to the return of some collateral, Goldman attempted to have the CDO pay them with securities
rather than cash, so that the CDO would preserve the cash in its collateral account.  The Broadwick collateral
manager objected and complained in an email sent to Mr. Sparks, stating in part:

      
      

“In case I wasn’t clear on the call, our three main points would be:
1. The aim of the collateral account was to provide LIBOR and not add additional risk to the deal.
2. GS said they would take market risk and clearly represented that to us and to the ratings agencies.
3. The only way the deal works, and the way the deal was marketed and explained to us, is that paydowns 
are equivalent to partial terminations. We do not believe you have any right to refuse to release excess
cash that is no longer needed as collateral, and we do not believe you have the right to release bonds
into the waterfall ever, and certainly not when cash exists.  Perhaps the way you did these deals
changed over time and you are comparing our deal to ones which you marketed or structured
later/differently?  I look forward to hearing from you.”

All of the listed securities consisted of AAA rated securities backed by residential

mortgages, credit card receivables, automobile loans, or student loans, and had an expected maturity
of two years or less.  It appears as if Goldman was restricting the selection of default swap collateral
securities to a limited list of assets that it believed were likely to maintain their par value in order to
minimize its financial exposure.   

After indicating it would allow these new purchases, Goldman maintained tight control over

the actual purchases made by the collateral managers.  A September 27, 2007 email exchange
between Mr. Marconi of Greywolf and Mr. Bieber of Goldman, for example, demonstrates
Goldman’s intense monitoring effort:
  

Mr. Marconi:  “Matt: I am seeing this list from another dealer.  Can I assume that I can buy
any name on your approved list?” ... 
Mr. Bieber:  “No-we need to give approval on a security by security basis.”

When asked about these matters, both Mr. Sparks and Mr. Lehman characterized the default

swap collateral securities issue as a minor issue.  Mr. Lehman informed the Subcommittee that he
did not recall significant debate with collateral managers on the matter.
difference between keeping the collateral in cash and investing in securities was minimal and
characterized the whole issue as “structured finance gymnastics.”
  But information supplied by
Goldman to the Subcommittee on seven Goldman-originated CDOs shows that, due to its duties as
collateral put provider and the declining value of the CDOs’ default swap collateral securities,
Goldman eventually lost over $1 billion.2670

Analysis.  In its synthetic CDOs, Goldman arranged for its subsidiary, GSI, to act as both
the primary CDS counterparty and the collateral put provider.  Goldman also arranged for GSI to
receive a fee for serving as the collateral put provider, through paying reduced premiums in
connection with the CDS contracts it entered into with the CDOs.  Despite this fee, Goldman took
actions to evade its responsibilities as the collateral put provider, including by refusing to approve
the purchase of new default swap collateral securities whose values might decline below par value. 
Instead, Goldman tried to force the CDOs to keep their collateral in cash.  While this effort provided
more protection for Goldman’s financial interest as the short party, it worked to the disadvantage of
the CDO investors because it produced lower returns for the CDOs than the purchase of default
swap collateral securities.  

When the Timberwolf collateral manager objected, Goldman backed down and allowed the

purchase of a narrow range of very safe, short term asset backed securities as collateral for
Timberwolf and other CDOs.  Goldman’s conduct in the Timberwolf CDO demonstrates how a
financial institution that plays multiple roles in a CDO can develop conflicts of interest and attempt
to manipulate the CDO to place its own financial interests before those of the investors to whom it
sold the CDO securities.

602 

 

(6)  Analysis of Goldman’s Conflicts of Interest  
 
The Goldman Sachs case study identifies a number of practices that raise conflict of 

interest concerns.  Those practices include the following. 

 
1. 

 
2. 

 
4. 

 
6. 

Shorting Its Own Securities.  In Hudson, Anderson, and Timberwolf, Goldman 
marketed CDO securities to clients, took a substantial portion of the short side of 
the CDO, bet the CDO would fall in value, and profited from its short position at 
the expense of the clients to whom it sold the securities. 

Failing to Disclose Key Information to Investors.  In Hudson, Anderson, and 
Timberwolf, Goldman represented to potential investors that its interests “were 
aligned” with theirs or advertised its retention of a portion of the CDO’s equity 
tranche, without disclosing that it had an even larger short position in the CDO and 
held a financial interest directly adverse to the investors to whom it was selling the 
CDO securities. 

 
3.  Misrepresenting Source of Assets.  In Hudson, Goldman provided 100% of the 

CDO assets using CDS contracts it controlled and priced, transferred $1.2 billion of 
risk from its own inventory to the CDO, and told investors the assets had been 
“sourced from the Street,” when they had been supplied solely by Goldman and not 
priced from transactions with third parties.  

Failing to Disclose Client Involvement.  In Abacus, Goldman enabled a client 
who was shorting the CDO to help select the CDO’s assets, solicited investors to 
buy the Abacus securities without disclosing the short party’s asset selection role or 
investment objective, and helped the client gain a $1 billion profit at the expense of 
the investors to whom Goldman sold the securities. 

   
5.  Minimizing Premiums.  In Abacus, Goldman entered into an undisclosed 

agreement with the sole short party to accept a fee for arranging low premium 
payments by the short party to the CDO, even though low premium payments 
meant less money for the long investors to whom Goldman had sold the Abacus 
securities. 

Selling Securities Designed to Fail.  Goldman sold Hudson and Abacus securities 
to clients knowing the securities were designed to fall in value and benefit the short 
party, which was a client in the case of Abacus and itself in the case of Hudson. 

 
7.  Delaying Liquidation. In Hudson, Goldman was paid a fee to serve as the 

liquidation agent, but delayed liquidating assets that were losing value for eight 
months, enhancing its financial gain as the CDO’s short party at the expense of the 
long parties whose losses would have been staunched if the assets had been 
liquidated. 

 

603 

8.   Misrepresenting Assets.  In Anderson, when clients asked how Goldman got 

“comfortable” with poor quality New Century loans in the CDO, Goldman worked 
to dispel those concerns and failed to disclose its own discomfort with New Century 
loans and that it held 40% of the short side of the CDO, betting its assets would lose 
value.  

 
9.  Taking Immediate Post-Sale Markdowns.  In Timberwolf, Goldman knowingly 
sold Timberwolf securities to clients at prices above its own book values and then, 
often within days or weeks of a sale, marked down the value of the sold securities, 
causing clients to incur quick losses and requiring some to post higher margin or 
cash collateral. 

 
10.  Evading Put Obligation.  In Timberwolf, Goldman was paid a fee to serve as the 
collateral put provider, but refused for two months to allow the purchase of default 
swap collateral securities, even though they meant better returns for long investors, 
because Goldman did not want to assume the risk that the collateral securities might 
lose value. 

 
11.  Using Poor Quality Loans in Securitizations.  Goldman provided securitization 

services and warehouse accounts to lenders with a history of issuing high risk, poor 
quality loans, and knowingly included poor quality loans in Goldman-originated 
RMBS and CDO securities. 

 
12.  Concealing Its Net Short Position.  From late 2006 through most of 2007, 

Goldman engaged in a relentless effort to sell the CDO and RMBS securities it 
underwrote, without disclosing to the clients it solicited that Goldman was 
simultaneously shorting the subprime market and betting it would lose value.  

 
These practices raise a wide range of ethical and legal concerns.  This section examines 
the key issues of whether Goldman had a legal obligation to disclose to clients the existence of 
material adverse information, including conflicts of interest, when selling them RMBS and CDO 
securities; whether Goldman had material adverse interests that should have been disclosed to 
investors; and whether Goldman had an obligation not to recommend securities that were 
designed to lose value.  Many of these issues hinge upon the proper treatment of financial 
instruments, such as credit default swaps and CDOs, which enable an investment bank to bet 
against the very same securities it is selling to clients.  

 
(a)  Securities Laws 
 
To protect fair, open, and efficient markets for investors, federal securities laws impose a 
range of specific disclosure and fair dealing obligations on market participants, depending upon 
the securities activities they undertake.  In the matters examined by the Subcommittee, the key 
roles under the securities laws include market maker, underwriter, placement agent, broker-
dealer, and investment adviser.   

604 

 

Market Maker.  A “market maker” is typically a dealer in financial instruments that 

stands ready to buy and sell a particular financial instrument on a regular and continuous basis at 
a publicly quoted price.2671  A major responsibility of a market maker is filling orders on behalf 
of customers.  Market markers do not solicit customers; instead they maintain buy and sell 
quotes in a public setting, demonstrating their readiness to either buy or sell the specified 
security, and customers come to them.  For example, a market maker in a particular stock 
typically posts the prices at which it is willing to buy or sell that stock, attracting customers 
based on the competitiveness of its prices.  This activity by market makers helps provide 
liquidity and efficiency in the trading market for that security.2672
  Market makers do not keep 
the financial instruments they buy and sell in their own investment portfolio, but instead keep 
them in their sales portfolio or “trading book.”   

 
Market makers have among the most narrow disclosure obligations under federal 

securities law, since they typically do not actively solicit clients or make investment 
recommendations to them.  Their disclosure obligations are generally limited to providing fair 
and accurate information related to the execution of a particular trade.2673  Market makers are 
also subject to the securities laws’ prohibitions against fraud and market manipulation.  In 
addition, they are subject to legal requirements relating to the handling of customer orders, for 
example using best execution efforts when placing a client’s buy or sell order.2674

 

 
Underwriter and Placement Agent.   Underwriters and placement agents have greater 

disclosure obligations than market makers, because in this role they are actively soliciting 
customers to buy new securities they have helped an issuer bring to market. 

 
When securities are offered to the public for sale, they are typically underwritten by one 

  An underwriter is typically hired by the issuer of the new 

or more investment banks, each of which is a broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority (FINRA).2675
securities to help the issuer register the securities with the SEC and conduct a public offering of 
the securities.  The underwriter typically purchases the securities from the issuer, holds them on 
its books, conducts the public offering, and bears the financial risk until the securities are sold to 
the public. 
                                                           
2671  Section 3(a)(38) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“The term ‘market maker’ means any specialist 
permitted to act as a dealer, any dealer acting in the capacity of block positioner, and any dealer who, with respect to 
a security, holds himself out (by entering quotations in an inter-dealer communications system or otherwise) as 
being willing to buy and sell such security for his own account on a regular or continuous basis.”); see also SEC

2675  FINRA is the largest independent self-regulatory organization for securities firms doing business in the United 
States.  FINRA has been delegated authority by the SEC and a number of securities exchanges to regulate the 
broker-dealer industry.  Its stated mission is “to protect America’s investors by making sure the securities industry 
operates fairly and honestly.”  See FINRA website, http://www.finra.org.

Investment banks can also act as “placement agents,” assisting those seeking to raise 

money through a private offering of securities by helping them design the securities, produce the 
offering materials, and market the new securities to investors.  Placement agents are also 
registered broker-dealers.  While public offerings of securities are required to be registered and 
filed with the SEC, private offerings are made to a limited number of investors and are exempt 
from SEC registration.  In the securitization industry, RMBS securities are generally sold 
through public offerings, while CDO securities are generally sold through private placements. 

 
Whether acting as an underwriter or placement agent, a major part of the investment 

bank’s responsibility is to solicit customers to buy the new securities being offered.  Under the 
securities laws, an issuer selling new securities to potential investors has an affirmative duty to 
disclose material information that a reasonable investor would want to know.2676  In addition, 
under securities law, a broker-dealer acting as an underwriter or placement agent is liable for any 
material misrepresentation or omission of material fact made in connection with a solicitation or 
sale of securities to an investor.2677

  

 
The Supreme Court has held that a fact is material if there is a “substantial likelihood that 

the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having 
significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available.”2678
  The SEC has provided 
this additional guidance: 

 
“‘The question of materiality, it is universally agreed, is an objective one, involving the 
significance of an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable investor.’  ‘[T]he 
reaction of individual investors is not determinative of materiality, since the standard is 
objective, not subjective.’  ‘[M]ateriality depends on the significance the reasonable 
investor would place on the withheld or misrepresented information.’  Although in 
general materiality is primarily a factual inquiry, ‘the question of materiality is to be 
resolved as a matter of law when the information is ‘so obviously important [or 

                                                           
2676  See, e.g., SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 201 (1963) (“Experience has shown that 
disclosure in such situations, while not onerous to the advisor, is needed to preserve the climate of fair dealing 
which is so essential to maintain public confidence in the securities industry and to preserve the economic health of 
the country.”).  See also SEC Study on Investment Advisers and Broker-Dealers at 51 [citations omitted] (“Under 
the so-called ‘shingle’ theory … a broker-dealer makes an implicit representation to those persons with whom it 
transacts business that it will deal fairly with them, consistent with the standards of the profession. …  Actions 
taken by the broker-dealer that are not fair to the customer must be disclosed in order to make this implied 
representation of fairness not misleading.”).  
2677  See Sections 11 and 12 of Securities Act of 1933.  See also Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934.  See also SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. at 200 (“Failure to disclose material facts 
must be deemed fraud or deceit within its intended meaning, for, as the experience of the 1920’s and 1930’s amply 
reveals, the darkness and ignorance of commercial secrecy are the conditions upon which predatory practices best 
thrive.”).  See also Goldman response to Subcommittee QFR, at PSI_QFR_GS0046.

unimportant] to an investor, that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of 
materiality.’”2679
 
Unlike when a broker-dealer is acting as a market maker, a broker-dealer acting as an 

 

underwriter or placement agent has an obligation to disclose material information to every 
investor it solicits, including the existence of any material conflict of interest or adverse interest.  
This duty arises from two sources:  the duties of an underwriter specifically, and the duties of a 
broker-dealer generally, when making an investment recommendation to a customer.   

 
With respect to the duties of an underwriter, the First Circuit has observed that 

underwriters have a “unique position” in the securities industry: 

 
“[T]he relationship between the underwriter and its customer implicitly involves a 
favorable recommendation of the issued security.  …  Although the underwriter cannot be 
a guarantor of the soundness of any issue, he may not give it his implied stamp of 
approval without having a reasonable basis for concluding that the issue is sound.”2680
 

 

With respect to a broker-dealer, the SEC has held: 
 

“[W]hen a securities dealer recommends a stock to a customer, it is not only obligated to 
avoid affirmative misstatements, but also must disclose material adverse facts to which it 
is aware.  That includes disclosure of ‘adverse interests’ such as ‘economic self interest’ 
that could have influenced its recommendation.”2681
 

   

The SEC has also stated that, if a broker intends to sell a security from its own inventory and 
recommends it to a customer, “the broker dealer must disclose all material facts.”2682
 

   

To help broker-dealers understand when they are obligated to disclose to investors 

material information, including any material adverse interest, FINRA has further defined the 
term “recommendation”:

self-interest”).  See also SEC Study on Investment Advisers and Broker-Dealers at 55.  In this recent study 
examining the disclosure obligations of broker-dealers and investment advisers, the SEC has explained:  
“Generally, under the anti-fraud provisions, a broker-dealer’s duty to disclose material information to its customer 
is based upon the scope of the relationship with the customer, which is fact intensive.”  According to the SEC, 
when a broker-dealer acts as an order taker or market maker in effecting a transaction for a customer, the broker-
dealer generally does not have a duty to disclose information regarding the security or the broker-dealer’s 
economic interest.  The duty to disclose this information is triggered, however, when the broker-dealer 
recommends a security.  Id. 
2682  SEC Study on Investment Advisers and Broker-Dealers at 56, n.252.

“[A] broad range of circumstances may cause a transaction to be considered 
recommended, and this determination does not depend on the classification of the 
transaction by a particular member as ‘solicited’ or ‘unsolicited.’  In particular a 
transaction will be considered to be recommended when the member or its associated 
person brings a specific security to the attention of the customer through any means, 
including, but not limited to, direct telephone communication, the delivery of 
promotional material through the mail, or the transmission of electronic messages.”2683
 

 

Goldman’s own compliance manual essentially incorporates this guidance and instructs Goldman 
personnel that a proactive effort to sell a specific investment to a specific customer constitutes a 
recommendation of that investment.2684
 

  

 

Once a broker-dealer, acting in the role of an underwriter or placement agent, has made 

an investment recommendation and triggered the duty to disclose any material adverse interest to 
a potential investor, it must disclose not only that the adverse interest exists, but also the “nature 
and extent” of the adverse interest.2685  In addition, it is not enough to inform a customer that the 
underwriter or placement agent “may” have an adverse interest if, in fact, the adverse interest 
already exists.2686  Further, there is no indication in any law or regulation that the obligation to 
disclose material adverse information is diminished or waived in relation to the level of 
sophistication of the potential investor.2687

Suitable Investment Recommendations.  In addition to requiring disclosure of material 

adverse information, federal securities laws and FINRA rules prohibit broker-dealers from 
making investment recommendations that would be unsuitable for any customer.2688

  

 
In a recent study, the SEC explained:  “[W]hile the suitability obligation under the federal 

securities laws arises from the anti-fraud provisions, the SRO [Self Regulatory Organization]  
rules are grounded in concepts of ethics, professionalism, fair dealing, and just and equitable 
principles of trade.”2689  For example, FINRA Rule 2010, providing Standards of Commercial 
Honor and Principles of Trade, states: “A member, in the conduct of its business, shall observe 
high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.”2690

  

 
A broker-dealer violates the suitability rule if it makes a recommendation that “is 

unsuitable for any investor, regardless of the investor’s wealth, willingness to bear risk, age or 
other individual characteristics.”2691  Under the applicable case law and FINRA rules, a broker-
dealer is also obligated “to have an ‘adequate and reasonable basis’ for any security or strategy 
recommendation that it makes.”2692
 

Suitability rules are intended to prevent abuses that contributed to the stock crash of 1929 
and the Great Depression of the 1930s, when Senators investigating investment bank activities at 
the time wrote the following: 
 

 

“[Investors] must believe that their investment banker would not offer them the bonds 
unless the banker believed them to be safe.  This throws a heavy responsibility upon the 
banker.  He may and does make mistakes.  There is no way that he can avoid making 
mistakes because he is human and because in this world, things are only relatively secure. 
There is no such thing as absolute security.  But while the banker may make mistakes, he

requires the broker to determine that the specific security recommended is appropriate based on the customer’s 
financial situation and needs.  FINRA Rule 2310.  The suitability obligation clearly applies to institutional 
customers, FINRA IM-2310-3 (suitability obligations to institutional customers require members have a reasonable 
basis for recommending a particular security or strategy), but may not apply when a broker-dealer solicits another 
broker-dealer to buy an investment since, under FINRA Rules, the term “customer” does not include a broker or 
dealer.  FINRA Manual, 0120 Definition.  On the other hand, the term “customer” has been given a broad 
definition under the securities case law.  See, e.g., Department of Enforcement v. Zayed, FINRA Complaint No. 
2006003834901 (August 19, 2010) (“Cases interpreting the term ‘customer’ in the securities context have viewed 
the term broadly to encompass individuals or entities that have some brokerage or investment relationship with the 
broker-dealer.  Specifically, courts have rejected the argument that an account is necessary to establish an 
investor’s status as a customer.” [citations omitted]).  When the Subcommittee asked Mr. Blankfein whether he 
believed there was a difference between a “customer” and a “client,” Mr. Blankfein said he had “never 
distinguished” between the two terms.  Subcommittee deposition of Lloyd Blankfein (12/15/2009), Hearing Exhibit

must never make the mistake of offering investments to his clients which he does not 
believe to be good.”2693

 

Investment Advisers.  For investment banks that act, not just as a broker-dealer, 

underwriter, or placement agent, but also as an investment adviser to their customers, federal 
securities laws impose still a higher legal duty.  When acting as an investment adviser, the law 
imposes a fiduciary obligation on the investment bank to act in the “best interests of its 
clients.”2694  A person qualifies as an “investment adviser” under the Investment Advisers Act if 
that person:  provides advice regarding securities, is in the business of providing such advice, 
and provides that advice for compensation.2695  A broker-dealer, however, is excluded from the 
Investment Advisers Act if the performance of its investment advisory services is “solely” 
incidental to its business as a broker-dealer, and the broker-dealer does not receive “special 
compensation” for providing those advisory services.2696  Because Goldman appears to have 
acted primarily as an underwriter, placement agent, or broker-dealer in carrying out its 
securitization activities, this section analyzes Goldman’s conduct in that context and not in the 
context of an investment adviser.2697
 

 

(b) Analysis 

 

 

 

 

One key issue is whether Goldman was acting as a market maker versus an underwriter 

or placement agent when it recommended that its clients purchase its CDO and RMBS securities, 
since those roles have different disclosure and suitability obligations under the law.  A second 
key issue is whether Goldman withheld material adverse information when recommending its 
securities to its clients, including the fact that it was shorting the securities it was selling.  A third 
key issue is whether Goldman violated its obligation to make suitable investment 
recommendations when urging customers to purchase securities that Goldman knew were 
designed to lose value. 

 
(i)  Claiming Market Maker Status 

Given its active role in the securitization markets, Goldman assumed a variety of roles in 

the development, marketing, and trade of RMBS and CDO products.  At times, it acted as a 
market maker responding to client orders to buy and sell RMBS and CDO products.  In addition, 
from 2006 to 2007, Goldman originated and served as an underwriter or placement agent for 27 
CDOs and 93 RMBS securitizations, and sold the resulting RMBS and CDO securities to a broad 
range of clients around the world.

In public statements and testimony regarding the financial crisis, Goldman has often 

highlighted its role as a market maker and downplayed its role as an underwriter or placement 
agent in the securitization markets.2698
example, Goldman executives repeatedly highlighted the firm’s role as market makers – buying 
and selling RMBS and CDO securities at the request of clients – while deemphasizing that the 
firm also originated new securities and affirmatively solicited clients to buy those new securities.  
 

  In the April 27, 2010 Subcommittee hearing, for 

In an exchange with Senator Susan Collins, for example, executives from Goldman’s 

Mortgage Department were asked questions about whether they were investment advisers with a 
fiduciary duty to their clients.  While not denying this duty, they emphasized their role as market 
makers with more limited client obligations:2699

 

 

Senator Collins:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to start my questioning by 
asking each of you a fundamental question.  Investment advisers have a legal obligation 
to act in the best interests of their clients.  Mr. Sparks, when you were working at 
Goldman, did you consider yourself to have a duty to act in the best interests of your 
clients? 
 
Mr. Sparks:  Senator, I had a duty to act in a very straightforward way, in a very open 
way with my clients.  Technically, with respect to investment advice, we were a market 
maker in that regard.  But with respect to being a prudent and a responsible participant in 
the market, we do have a duty to do that. 

Senator Collins:  Mr. Swenson? 
 
Mr. Swenson:  I believe it is our responsibility as market makers to provide a market-
level bid and offer to our clients and to serve our clients and helping them transact at 
levels that are fair market prices and help meet their needs. 

 
Mr. Tourre made similar representations in his prepared testimony to the Subcommittee: 
 

“Between 2004 and 2007, my job was primarily to make markets for clients.  I made 
markets by connecting clients who wished to take a long exposure to an asset – meaning 
they anticipated the value of the asset would rise – with clients who wished to take a 
short exposure to an asset – meaning they anticipated the value of the asset would fall.  I 

                                                           
2698  See, e.g., 3/1/2010 letter from Goldman’s legal counsel to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 
GS-PSI-01310 (discussing Goldman Sachs’ “Role as a market maker” in detail and distinguishing it, in a much 
shorter description, from its underwriting and placement roles).  Although the letter acknowledged that Goldman 
acted as an underwriter and placement agent for RMBS and CDO transactions, it also suggested that those 
transactions were commonly designed in response to client inquiries and did not discuss efforts by the firm to 
solicit customers to buy the securities:  “Goldman Sachs’ CDOs ... were initially created in response to the request 
of a sophisticated institutional investor that approached the firm specifically seeking that particular exposure.  
Reverse inquiries from clients were a common feature of this market.”

was an intermediary between highly sophisticated professional investors – all of which 
were institutions.  None of my clients were individual, retail investors.”2700

 

In another exchange, when Subcommittee Chairman Levin asked Goldman CEO Lloyd 

Blankfein about the firm’s duty as an underwriter and placement agent to disclose its adverse 
interests when selling its CDO securities to potential investors, Mr. Blankfein responded that 
market makers had no such disclosure obligations: 
 

Senator Levin:  You are betting against the very security that you are selling to that 
person.  You don’t see any problem?  You don’t see that you have to disclose, when you 
have put together a deal and you go looking for people to buy those securities, it just adds 
insult to injury when your people think it is a pile of junk.  But the underlying injury is 
that you have determined that you are going to keep the opposite position from the 
security that you are selling to someone.  You just don’t see any obligation to disclose 
that.  That is what seems to be coming through here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Blankfein:  I don’t believe there is a disclosure obligation, but as a market maker, I 
am not sure how a market would work if it was premised on the assumption that the other 
side of the market cared what your opinion was about the position they were taking. 

Senator Levin:  Do they have a belief that you, at least when you are going out peddling 
securities, that you want that security to succeed?  Don’t they have that right to assume 
that if you are going out selling securities, that you have a belief that that is something 
which would be good for that client? 
 
Mr. Blankfein:  I think we have to have a belief, and we do have a belief that if somebody 
wants an exposure to housing –  

Senator Levin:  They don’t want – you are out there selling it to them.  You are out there 
selling these securities.  This isn’t someone walking in the door. 

Mr. Blankfein:  Again, I want –  

Senator Levin:  You are picking up the phone.  You are calling all these people.  You 
don’t tell them that you think it is a piece of junk.  You don’t tell them that this is a 
security which incorporates or which in some way references a whole lot of bad stuff in 
your own inventory – bad lemons, they were called. ...  You are out there looking around 
for buyers of stuff, whether it is junk or not junk, where you are betting against what you 
are selling.  You are intending to keep the opposite side.  This isn’t where you are just 
selling something from your inventory.  This is where you are betting against the very 
product you are selling, and you are just not troubled by it.  That is the bottom line.  
There is no trouble in your mind –  

 
                                                           
2700  Prepared statement of Fabrice Tourre, April 27, 2010 Subcommittee Hearing at 1.  

612 

Mr. Blankfein:  Senator, I am sorry.  I can’t endorse your characterization. 

Senator Levin:  It is a question, not a characterization.  I am saying, you are not troubled. 

Mr. Blankfein:  I am not troubled by the fact that we market make as principal and that 
we are the opposite – when somebody sells, they sell to us, or when they buy, they buy 
from us.2701

 

Although Goldman representatives routinely emphasized the firm’s role as a market 
maker, when asked directly if the firm also functioned as an underwriter or placement agent 
when selling the CDO securities it originated, its executives agreed that in some circumstances, 
the firm played that role: 
 

Senator Pryor:  OK.  But let me ask this:  When you are selling a security such as a CDO, 
my understanding is you are not a market maker.  Isn’t it true that you are placement 
agent and as a placement agent you have a duty of full disclosure? 

Mr. Sparks:  Senator, that is correct.2702

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Similarly, in a written response to a Subcommittee question asking about the firm’s role in 
relation to Anderson, Hudson 1, Timberwolf and other CDOs, Mr. Blankfein wrote:  “Goldman 
Sachs or an affiliate served as a placement agent.”2703
  

Despite this acknowledged fact, Goldman continued to claim it was a market maker with 

 

limited disclosure and client obligations.  On May 1, 2010, for example, less than a week after 
the Subcommittee’s April 27 hearing, an article entitled, “Goldman Sachs’ Lloyd Blankfein 
Defends ‘Market Maker’ Firm on ‘Charlie Rose’ Show,” described Mr. Blankfein’s statements 
on the televised show as follows: 
 

 

 

 

 

“Asked by Rose whether Goldman investment advisers had ever bought securities from 
the firm, sold them to clients, and then bet against those same securities, Blankfein 
paused.  And after a solid six seconds of silence, sought to explain … Goldman’s role as 
a ‘market maker.’  

‘We’re like a machine, that lets people buy and sell what they want to buy and sell’ 
Blankfein said.  ‘That’s not the advisory business. That’s just a facility for market 
making.’”2704

During the interview, Mr. Blankfein compared Goldman’s activity to that of the New York Stock 
Exchange, claiming that the firm was a market maker taking buy and sell orders from clients.2705  
At one point, Mr. Rose asked:  “Has there ever been a time when Goldman’s investment advisers 
bought securities from Goldman for a client and at the same time Goldman was simultaneously 
shorting it?”  Mr. Blankfein responded:  “I have to explain, see this is a problem.  As a market 
maker, we are buying and selling a thousand times a minute, probably.”  Mr. Blankfein also 
stated during the interview:  “If we believed it would fail, the security wouldn’t work, we would 
not sell it.”2706
 

 

(ii)  Soliciting Clients and Recommending Investments 

 

Under federal securities law and FINRA Rules detailed above, when a broker-dealer, 

acting as an underwriter or placement agent brings a specific security to the attention of a 
particular customer, it is considered to be recommending the security to that customer and has an 
obligation to disclose all material adverse information to that customer, including any adverse 
interest that a reasonable investor would consider material in considering the broker-dealer’s 
recommendation.  Despite Goldman’s frequent efforts to characterize its CDO and RMBS sales 
efforts as a market making activity in response to client demand, Goldman’s internal documents, 
emails, and interviews indicate that, from late 2006 through 2007, Goldman was not always 
responding to client demand, but was also aggressively soliciting customers in an attempt to sell 
its CDO and RMBS products.   
 

In December 2006, for example, Goldman CFO David Viniar instructed the Mortgage 
Department to reduce its long position in mortgage related assets, including by selling RMBS 
and CDO products on its books.2707
effort to sell to clients the bulk of the RMBS and CDO products in its inventory.  The 
Subcommittee saw no evidence that this intensive selling campaign was undertaken in response 
to client demand.  To the contrary, the evidence shows that the sales effort was undertaken at the 
request of senior management, despite what was then waning investor interest in securitization 
products. 
 

  The Mortgage Department responded with a concerted 

In December 2006, on the same day Mr. Viniar directed the Mortgage Department to 

reduce its long assets, Kevin Gasvoda, head of the desk that handled RMBS securities, told his 
staff to “move stuff out even if you have to take a small loss.”2708
  In January 2007, Mr. Sparks, 
head of the Mortgage Department, asked a senior executive to compliment the CDO Origination 
Desk head and his staffer for their efforts to sell a specific CDO’s securities over the prior

month:  “They structured like mad and traveled the world, and worked their tails off to make 
some lemonade out of some big old lemons.”2709  In March 2007, Mr. Sparks emailed a call for 
“help” to Goldman’s top sales managers around the world to “sell our new issues – CDOs and 
RMBS – and to sell our other cash trading positions.”2710  He wrote:  “I can’t over state the 
importance to the business of selling these positions and new issues. …  Priority 1 – sell our new 
issues and cash positions.”2711  In April 2007, the Mortgage Department issued one of many 
sales directives to Goldman’s global sales force, placing a priority on selling certain CDO 
securities in its inventory, including securities from Anderson, Timberwolf, Point Pleasant, and 
Altius CDOs, and Mr. Sparks recommended providing large sales credits for those able to 
complete the sales.2712

 

 
The documents also show that Goldman personnel worked relentlessly to identify 

possible clients and pitch CDO securities to them.  In March 2007, for example, the Syndicate 
Desk contributed a list of “non-traditional buyers” that could be targeted for CDO sales, writing 
that “we continue to push for leads.”2713  A Goldman sales manager suggested targeting 
European and Middle Eastern banks and hedge funds.2714  In New York, a Goldman sales 
representative recounted that the Abacus CDO security “has been showed to selected accounts 
for the past few weeks.  Those selected accounts previously declined participating in Anderson 
mezz, Point Pleasant, and Timberwolf.”2715

 

 
When CDO sales slowed in May 2007, the Mortgage Department produced a new 

“target” list of four primary and 35 secondary clients for CDO sales.2716  A few days later, a 
Goldman salesperson reported that he planned to contact a hedge fund about Timberwolf and 
Point Pleasant securities, noting that the customer was “[n]ot expert[] in this space at all but [I] 
made them a lot of money in correlation dislocation and will do as I suggest.”2717  In Australia, a 
Goldman sales representative contacted an Australian hedge fund, Basis Capital, and mounted a 
sustained effort to sell it $100 million in Timberwolf securities, overcoming investor concerns to 
make the sale.2718

Timberwolf securities to a Korean life insurance firm was encouraged to “Get ‘er done” and “go 
for it” by his superiors when he informed them “we are pushing on our personal relationships to 
get this done.”2719

  

 
These and other documents show that, in late 2006 and 2007, Goldman was not acting as 

primarily a market maker responding to client demand when it originated and sold Hudson, 
Anderson, Timberwolf, and Abacus securities, or when it sold other RMBS and CDO assets that 
senior management wanted to remove from the firm’s books due to their declining values and 
increasing risk.  Instead, Goldman was acting as an underwriter, placement agent, or broker-
dealer, aggressively soliciting its clients to purchase the CDO and RMBS products that senior 
management wanted to eliminate from its inventory.  
 

(iii)  Failing to Disclose Material Adverse Information 

 

Goldman’s marketing and solicitation efforts to sell Hudson, Anderson, Timberwolf, and 

Abacus securities, along with other CDO and RMBS assets, to clients raise multiple questions 
about whether Goldman met its obligation to disclose material adverse information to potential 
investors.  A related question is whether Goldman met its obligation to avoid material 
misrepresentations and omissions of material facts when recommending the purchase of those 
securities.  One key issue is whether Goldman’s failure to disclose its shorting activities, which 
would enable it to profit from a decline in the value of the very securities Goldman was 
recommending to its clients to purchase, qualified as an “omitted fact” that “would have been 
viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information 
made available” about the security being recommended by Goldman.2720

  

 
Taking the Short Side of a CDO.  In the four CDOs examined in this Report, Goldman 
took 100% of the short side of Hudson, 40% of the short side of Anderson, and 36% of the short 
side of Timberwolf.2721  In each of these CDOs, Goldman also made a relatively small 
investment in the long side of the CDO by initially retaining all or a portion of its equity tranche, 
allowing Goldman to claim an “interest” in the CDO’s long term success.2722
Goldman did not intend to make any investment in the CDO itself, and instead enabled the client 
that had requested construction of the CDO and played a key role in selecting its assets to hold 
100% of the short side of the CDO.   

  In Abacus,

the originator.  Equity tranches are typically not rated by the credit rating agencies and often not sold to third 
parties.

Goldman did not accurately or fully disclose its short interest in Hudson, Anderson, or 
Timberwolf to potential investors.2723
  Instead, the CDOs’ offering materials advised potential 
investors, in difficult to understand language, that a Goldman affiliate “may” adopt a financial 
interest or investment position adverse to the investors when, in fact, Goldman had already 
determined to do so.  In a section entitled, “Certain Conflicts of Interest,” for example, the 
Hudson 1 Offering Circular stated in part: 

 
 “Certain Conflicts of Interest.  Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise 
from the overall activities of the Credit Protection Buyer, the overall underwriting, 
investment and other activities of the Liquidation Agent, the Senior Swap Counterparty 
and the Collateral Put Provider, their respective affiliates and its clients and employees 
and from the overall investment activity of the Initial Purchaser, including in other 
transactions with the Issuer.  The following briefly summarizes some of these conflicts, 
but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts. 

 

 

 

“The Credit Protection Buyer and Senior Swap Counterparty.  GSI [Goldman Sachs 
International] will be the initial Credit Protection Buyer and the initial Senior Swap 
Counterparty.  The following briefly summarizes some potential and actual conflicts of 
interests related to the Credit Protection Buyer and Senior Swap Counterparty, but the 
following isn’t intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.  ... 

“GSI and/or any of its affiliates may invest and/or deal, for their own respective accounts 
for which they have investment discretion, in securities or in other interests in the 
Reference Entities, in obligations of the Reference Entities or in the obligors in respect of 
any Reference Obligations or Collateral Securities (the “Investments”) or in credit default 
swaps (whether as protection buyer or seller) ....  In addition, GSI and/or any of its 
affiliates may invest and/or deal, for their own respective accounts or for accounts for 
which they have investment discretion, in securities (or make loans or have other rights) 
that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, any of the Investments 
and may act as adviser to, may be lenders to, and may have other ongoing relationships 
with, the issuers or obligors of Investments and obligations of any Reference 
Entities.”2724
 
This disclosure indicates that GSI or an affiliate “may invest and/or deal” in securities or 

 

other “interests” in the assets underlying the Hudson CDO, and “may invest and/or deal” in 
securities that are “adverse to” the Hudson “investments.”  The Offering Circular, however, 
misrepresented Goldman’s investment plans.  At the time it was created in December 2006, 
Goldman had already determined to keep 100% of the short side of the Hudson CDO and act as 

                                                           
2723  In Abacus, Goldman also failed to disclose the role of the hedge fund in the Abacus asset selection process.  
See Abacus section C(5)(b)(ii)DD, above.

the sole counterparty to the investors buying Hudson securities, thereby acquiring a $2 billion 
financial interest that was directly adverse to theirs.2725

   

617 

 
A federal court has held that disclosing a potential adverse interest, when a known 

adverse interest already exists, can constitute a material misstatement to investors.2726
  In the 
case of the Hudson CDO, much of the profit Goldman obtained would be generated from the 
losses incurred by clients that bought Hudson securities, creating an actual, undisclosed adverse 
interest.  This construct, in which Goldman’s profits depended in part upon its clients’ losses, 
created a clear conflict of interest between Goldman and the clients to whom it was selling the 
Hudson securities, once Goldman had decided to become a short party in the CDO it was 
simultaneously marketing.  

 
In another part of the Offering Circular, Goldman stated that GSI would serve as the sole 

counterparty to the CDO, but that disclosure was made in the context of a common industry 
practice in which the CDO originator or its designate typically took the entire short side of the 
transaction in the first instance and was the only party that dealt directly with the shell 
corporation actually issuing the CDO’s securities.  The CDO originator, or its designate, then 
acted as an intermediary between the shell corporation and the other broker-dealers buying short 
positions in the CDO on behalf of themselves or a customer.  By placing itself in the middle of 
each CDS contract, the originator or its designate provided stronger financial backing for the 
CDS contracts being issued by the CDO and obtained more favorable credit ratings for the CDO 
securities.  In the CDOs examined by the Subcommittee, Goldman followed industry practice by 
designating its affiliate, GSI, as the initial sole counterparty in the Hudson, Anderson, and 
Timberwolf CDOs.2727
Hudson CDO would likely have assumed that GSI planned to sell its initial short position to 
other parties, since that was industry practice.  What Goldman failed to disclose to those 
customers is that it planned to hold (or already held) all or a substantial portion of the short side 
of the CDO as a proprietary investment adverse to the interests of the customers to whom 
Goldman was selling the CDO securities.  Had those customers known of Goldman’s substantial 
short investment, they would likely have understood that Goldman viewed the very CDO 
securities it was recommending they purchase as likely not to perform. 

  Customers learning of GSI’s role as the initial sole counterparty in the

2726 See, e.g., SEC v. Czuczko, Case No. CV06-4792 (USDC CD Calif.), Order Granting Plaintiff’s Unopposed 
Motion for Summary Judgment (Dec. 5, 2007) (finding defendant made a material misstatement to potential 
investors when he disclosed that officers, directors, employees and members of their families “may” trade in the 
stocks recommended on his website, without disclosing that he, his father, and business partner were trading in 
those stocks and had an interest in them).  See also In the Matter of Arleen Hughes, Securities Exchange Act Rel. 
No. 4048 (Feb. 1948) (holding a broker-dealer, who is also a registered investment adviser, had to disclose the 
“nature and extent” of its adverse interest); In the Matter of Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P., Exchange Act Rel. No. 
50910 (Dec. 22, 2004) (settled order), at 21 (disclosure inadequate for failing to disclose full nature and extent of 
the broker-dealer’s conflict of interest).  
2727  Goldman sometimes referred to this position as the “Credit Protection Buyer” or “Synthetic Security 
Counterparty.” 

 

Goldman’s failure to disclose its short interest was further compounded when it told 

618 

investors that its interests “were aligned” with those of the long investors or when it advertised 
its retention of a portion of the CDO’s equity tranche.  The Hudson marketing booklet stated:  
“Goldman Sachs has aligned incentives with the Hudson program by investing in a portion of 
equity and playing the ongoing role of Liquidation Agent.”2728  What made the statement 
misleading and what Goldman failed to disclose in the booklet was that its $6 million equity 
investment2729 was far outweighed by its $2 billion short investment.2730  In addition, Goldman 
later used its liquidation agent position to benefit its short investment at the expense of the long 
investors in Hudson.2731  In Anderson, talking points prepared for the Goldman sales force 
advocated telling investors:  “Goldman is underwriting the equity and expects to hold up to 
50%.”2732  What the talking points left out was that Goldman’s $21 million equity investment in 
Anderson was less than one sixth the size of its $135 million short position.2733  In Timberwolf, 
the marketing booklet stated that Goldman was purchasing 50% of the equity tranche, and the 
collateral manager Greywolf was purchasing the other 50%.2734  Again, the booklet failed to 
disclose that Goldman’s equity investment was far outweighed by its short investment.2735
  In 
each CDO, Goldman withheld from investors information that it had a more significant financial 
interest in seeing the CDO decline in value than increase in value.  In light of its short 
investments, Goldman’s claims that its interests were aligned with, rather than adverse, to the 
investors to whom it was selling the CDO securities were misleading. 
 

Shorting the Subprime Market.  Goldman also failed to disclose to clients that, at the 

same time it was recommending investments in Goldman-originated RMBS and CDO securities, 
it was committing billions of dollars to short the same types of securities, as well as their 
underlying assets,2736 and even some of the lenders whose mortgage pools were included or 
referenced in the securities.2737  In February 2007, Goldman’s net short totaled about $10 
billion.2738
this omitted information – that Goldman was heavily shorting the same types of investments it 
was recommending – “would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having 

  In June 2007, its net short reached about $13.9 billion.  A significant issue is whether

specific CDOs as well as the subprime mortgage market as a whole, Goldman failed to disclose 
other arrangements which created conflicts of interest and undisclosed financial interests that 
were adverse to its clients.  Concerning Abacus, Goldman failed to disclose a compensation 
arrangement in which Goldman agreed to accept a fee for arranging low premium payments by 
the short party; those lower payments disadvantaged the long investors by reducing cash 
payments to the CDO.  Concerning Hudson, Goldman failed to disclose that its dual roles as 
liquidation agent and sole short party meant that it could delay liquidating Hudson assets that 
were losing value and simultaneously increase the value of its short position; that same action 
increased the losses of the long investors.  In Timberwolf, Goldman failed to disclose that it 
viewed its role as collateral put provider allowed it to refuse to consent to the purchase of default 
swap collateral securities and avoid any risk that the securities would decline in value – the very 
risk the long investors were paying Goldman a fee to assume.2740
  In each CDO, Goldman took 
actions that created an undisclosed conflict of interest between itself and the investors to whom it 
recommended and sold the CDO securities. 

 
These types of arrangements, when undisclosed, can result in conflicts of interest that 
disadvantage investors.  The existence, nature, and extent of such arrangements are the type of 
material adverse information that the securities laws were designed to ensure were accurately 
described and disclosed to investors. 

 
(iv)  Making Unsuitable Investment Recommendations  

 

619 

 
significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available” about the securities Goldman 
was recommending.2739

   

 
Other Adverse Information.  In addition to its failure to disclose that it was shorting 

In addition to the disclosure issues, Goldman’s efforts to sell Hudson, Anderson, 

Timberwolf, and Abacus securities raise a set of issues related to whether Goldman met its 
obligation to engage in fair dealing with its clients and avoid recommending investments that 
were unsuitable for any investor.  The focus here is on Goldman’s sale of CDO securities that 
were designed to lose value, either because the short party selected the assets or the assets were 
so poor that Goldman knew or should have known they would perform poorly or fail, yet 
marketed them to customers anyway. 
                                                           
2739  That Goldman’s own investment decisions might be material information for an investor is demonstrated by a 
court ruling in a famous case in the 1970s, in which Goldman, an exclusive dealer, was sued by an investor who 
alleged that Goldman had sold it Penn Central notes without disclosing, among other things, that Goldman had 
recently reduced and placed limits on its own inventory of those same notes.  Alton Boxboard v. Goldman, Sachs 
and Company, 560 F.2d 916 (8th Cir. 1977).  Although the court decided the case on another basis, the Eighth 
Circuit found that the materiality of the undisclosed facts alleged was a question to be decided by a trier of fact.  
The court took note of the testimony from two sophisticated institutional purchasers concerning Goldman’s 
reduction of inventory in Penn Central notes.  Id at n.10.  One sophisticated investor “testified that this information 
would have been a ‘red flag’ to him, and had he known of Goldman Sachs’ inventory decision, he would have 
wanted notes from another issuer.”  Id.  The other witness “stated he would have been concerned about such 
information and would have conveyed it to his customers, because it indicated that Goldman, Sachs did not have 
confidence in ... [the] notes.”  Id. 
2740  Each of these matters is discussed in detail, above. 

 

620 

As detailed earlier, broker-dealers are required to deal fairly with their customers and 
observe high standards of honor in the conduct of their business.2741  When a broker-dealer, 
acting as an underwriter, makes an investment recommendation to a client, it is implicit that the 
broker-dealer has a reasonable basis to believe that the issue is sound.2742  A broker-dealer is also 
required “to have an ‘adequate and reasonable basis’ for any security or strategy 
recommendation that it makes.”2743  Broker-dealers are barred from offering investments that are 
unsuitable for any investor.2744  Goldman itself, in response to a Subcommittee question, has 
acknowledged that broker-dealers owe a “general suitability” obligation to its institutional 
investors, and “[t]his suitability duty requires the broker-dealer to determine, in the first instance, 
that the transaction is suitable for at least some investors.”2745  Despite those requirements, the 
evidence gathered by the Subcommittee indicates that Goldman did not view any of the four 
CDOs examined in this Report as sound investments for the clients to whom it sold the 
securities.2746

   

 
Selection of Assets by Short Party.  Internal documents and emails from Goldman 

indicate that both Abacus and Hudson were designed with the expectation they would lose value 
and produce a profit for the short side of the CDOs.  The sole short party in Abacus was the 
Paulson hedge fund; the sole short party in Hudson was Goldman itself.    

 
With respect to Abacus, Goldman knew that the Paulson hedge fund wanted to take 

100% of the short side and would profit only if the CDO lost value, yet allowed the hedge fund 
to play a major but hidden role in selecting the CDO assets.2747  The Goldman employee with 
lead responsibility for Abacus, Fabrice Tourre, called it a “weak quality portfolio.”2748  The 
Paulson hedge fund executive who participated in the asset selection process acknowledged he 
selected assets that he expected would not perform well.2749  A Moody’s executive who oversaw 
CDO ratings when Abacus was rated – and testified that he did not know of Paulson’s role in the 
Abacus asset selection process – explained that “[i]t just changes the whole dynamic of the 
structure where the person who is putting it together, choosing it, wants it to blow up.”2750  When 
Goldman began to publicly market the Abacus securities, Ed Steffelin, a Senior trader at GSC 
who had declined Goldman’s request that his firm serve as the CDO’s portfolio selection agent, 
sent an email to Peter Ostrem, head of Goldman’s CDO Origination Desk, stating:  “I do not 
have to say how bad it is that you guys are pushing this thing.”2751
Subcommittee what he meant by that comment, Mr. Steffelin said that he believed the Abacus

  When asked by the 

621 

 

 
CDO created “reputational risk” for the collateral manager industry and the whole market.2752  
When Mr. Tourre later sought to book two CDS contracts referencing the Abacus securities, a 
Goldman salesman wrote:  “seems we might have to book these pigs.”2753

 
As planned, once issued, the Abacus securities quickly lost value.  In October 2007, six 
months after the Abacus securities were issued, the credit rating agencies downgraded them, and 
a Goldman salesperson noted:  “This deal was number 1 in the universe of CDO’s that were 
downgraded by Moody’s and S&P.  99.89% of the underlying assets were downgraded.”2754  The 
three investors that bought Abacus securities together lost more than $1 billion, while the 
Paulson hedge fund, as the sole short party, recorded a corresponding $1 billion profit.2755  In 
July 2010, Goldman agreed to settle a securities fraud complaint brought by the SEC by paying a 
fine of $550 million and “acknowledging it was a mistake for the Goldman marketing materials 
to state that the reference portfolio was ‘selected by’ ACA Management, LLC without disclosing 
the role of Paulson & Co. Inc. in the portfolio selection process and that Paulson’s economic 
interests were adverse to CDO investors.”2756

      

 

 
With respect to Hudson, Goldman designed the CDO from its inception as a way to 

transfer the risk of loss associated with ABX assets from Goldman’s inventory to the Hudson 
investors.2757  Goldman documents state, for example, that Hudson was “initiated by the firm as 
the most efficient method to reduce long ABX exposures,”2758 and the CDO was an “exit for our 
long ABX risk.”2759
  Goldman created and took the short side of $2 billion in single name CDS 
contracts referencing RMBS securities that it wanted to short, and sold them to the Hudson 
CDO.  The end result was that Goldman wrote 100% of the CDS contracts that made up 
Hudson’s assets and took 100% of the short side of the CDO, which meant that Goldman would 
profit if the CDO fell in value.  Goldman marketed the CDO without disclosing its status as the 
sole short party, instead telling investors that its interests were “aligned” with theirs.  The 
Hudson securities immediately began losing value.  Within a year, while the holders of the 
Hudson securities lost virtually their entire investments, Goldman’s profits reached $1.7 billion, 
which it then used to offset other mortgage related losses. 

 
In both CDOs, Goldman took actions that disguised that the transactions were designed to 

lose value.  In Abacus, Goldman omitted mention of the Paulson hedge fund’s involvement in 
the asset selection process and hired a well known third party portfolio agent, ACA

Management, to “leverage ACA’s credibility.”2760  In Hudson, Goldman omitted that it had 
written all of the CDO’s CDS contracts and it referenced $1.2 billion in ABX assets in 
Goldman’s own inventory, and instead told investors that Hudson’s assets were “sourced from 
the Street” and Hudson was “not a Balance Sheet CDO.”2761

 
Goldman marketed the Abacus and Hudson securities to clients knowing that each CDO 
had been designed to lose value and produce a profit for the short party.  Given that information, 
Goldman marketed CDOs that it knew or should have known were not suitable for any investor.

Selection of Poor Quality Assets.  Similar concerns apply to Goldman’s origination and 
marketing of the Anderson and Timberwolf CDOs, which contained such poor quality assets that 
Goldman knew or should have known that they would perform poorly or fail.  Yet Goldman 
recommended them to investors anyway.  The issue is whether, by recommending that investors 
purchase the Anderson and Timberwolf securities, Goldman violated its fair dealing obligation 
and recommended investments that were not suitable for any investor.   

  
With respect to Anderson, Goldman personnel knew before marketing its securities that 
the CDO had poor quality assets that were losing value.  Nearly 45% of the referenced RMBS 
securities in Anderson were dependent upon loans issued by New Century, while another 7% 
depended upon loans issued by Fremont, two subprime lenders known, including by Goldman 
personnel, for issuing poor quality loans and poorly performing RMBS securities.2762  On 
February 24, 2007, Goldman personnel calculated that the assets in the Anderson warehouse 
account had already lost $60 million in value from the time they were purchased.2763  In 
response, Mr. Sparks, the Mortgage Department head, decided to cancel the CDO.2764
  Later, he 
changed his mind and rushed Anderson to market with only $305 million of the $500 million in 
assets that had been planned.  Goldman was the largest short party, with 40% of the short interest 
in Anderson.  

 
Anderson issued its securities on March 20, 2007.  Goldman knew at the time that both 
New Century and Fremont were in financial distress.2765  In addition, the week before, Goldman 
had conducted reviews of both a New Century and a Fremont loan pool on the firm’s books, and 
found that 26% of the New Century loans2766 and 50% of the Fremont loans2767

deficiencies and should be returned to the lender for refunds.  Goldman nevertheless continued to 
market the Anderson securities.  When some potential investors expressed concerns about 
Anderson’s underlying assets, in particular the New Century loans, Goldman tried to dispel those 
concerns even while harboring its own low opinion of New Century loans.2768  Goldman 
managed to sell approximately $102 million in Anderson securities to nine investors who lost 
virtually their entire investments within a year.2769

   

 
With respect to Timberwolf, Goldman personnel knew that the CDO’s assets had begun 
losing value almost from the time they were acquired.2770  Timberwolf was a CDO2 transaction 
comprised of 56 different CDO assets with over 4,500 unique underlying securities.2771  In 
February 2007, Mr. Sparks told a senior Goldman executive that it was a deal “to worry about,” 
and that its assets had already incurred such significant losses that they had exhausted the share 
of the warehouse risk held by Goldman’s partner in the transaction.2772  Despite that loss in 
value, Goldman continued with the issuance of the Timberwolf securities in March 2007.  By 
May, a special CDO valuation project undertaken by the Mortgage Department found that the 
Timberwolf’s assets had lost still more value.2773  Despite its lower internal valuation, Mr. 
Sparks advised Goldman senior executives that his CDO pricing strategy was to “take the write-
down, but market at much higher levels” to avoid “leaving some money on the table.”2774

  

 
During the spring and summer of 2007, Goldman aggressively marketed Timberwolf 
securities to investors around the world, eventually selling about $853 million in Timberwolf 
securities to 12 investors.2775  Goldman sold the securities at prices substantially above its 
internal book values for the Timberwolf securities.  After making a sale, Goldman then, 
sometimes only days or weeks later, marked down the value of the securities it had sold, 
resulting in investors realizing losses and sometimes requiring the investor to post additional 
cash margin or collateral.2776  In September 2007, an internal Goldman analysis found that, in 
just six months, Timberwolf’s AAA rated securities had lost 80% of their value.  One of 
Goldman’s senior executives monitoring Timberwolf pronounced it “one shitty deal.”2777
  The 
CDO was liquidated in October 2008, and the investors who purchased Timberwolf securities 
lost virtually their entire investments.

Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein said publicly about the firm’s securities:  “If we believed 

it would fail … the security wouldn’t work, we would not sell it.”2778   But Goldman marketed 
the Anderson and Timberwolf securities to clients knowing that each CDO had poor quality 
assets that were continually losing value.  It marketed them at the same time it was investing on 
the short side of the CDOs and the subprime mortgage market as a whole, and its Mortgage 
Department head was telling his staff that it was “Game Over” and time to “get out of 
everything.”2779
  Within a year, the Anderson and Timberwolf securities were virtually 
worthless.  Given what Goldman knew when marketing Anderson and Timberwolf, Goldman 
was recommending investments that were most likely not suitable for any investor. 

 

 
This analysis examines Goldman’s conduct in the context of the law prevailing in 2007.  

Since then, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 has 
established new conflict of interest prohibitions that would apply to this type of conduct, 
including Section 621 which bars any underwriter or placement agent of an asset backed security 
from engaging in any transaction “that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest 
with respect to any investor in a transaction arising out of such activity.” 

 

 

 
(7)  Goldman’s Proprietary Investments 

When reviewing the conflict of interest issues related to Goldman’s mortgage related 
activities in 2006 and 2007, another issue examined by the Subcommittee was the extent to 
which Goldman’s Mortgage Department was engaged in proprietary trading.2780

 

  In a 

 
In 2007, Goldman was not a commercial bank, and proprietary trading was not illegal.  

 
The issue that concerned the Subcommittee was the extent to which its proprietary activities may 
have contributed to the conflicts of interest that affected how Goldman operated.2781

2780  Until its repeal in 1999, the Glass-Steagall Act prohibited banks from engaging in proprietary trading.  Glass-
Steagall Act, Section 16.  The Act’s prohibition on proprietary trading was weakened over the years and finally 
repealed by the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, P.L. 106-102 (1999).  Since Goldman did not 
become a bank holding company until 2008, neither the Glass-Steagall prohibition nor its repeal affected its 
activities during the time period examined by the Subcommittee.   
2781  Financial institutions that trade for their own accounts at the same time that they conduct trades on behalf of 
their clients may experience conflicts of interest.  See, e.g., 4/23/2010 letter from John Reed, former Chairman and 
CEO of Citigroup, to Senators Merkley and Levin (“When a firm is focused on market gain through proprietary 
trading, it too often will employ every available device to achieve those gains B including take advantages of clients 
and putting the firm at risk.”); In re Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated, Exchange Act Rel. No. 
34-63760, Admin. Proc. 3-14204 (Jan. 25, 2011) (settling allegations that Merrill Lynch’s proprietary traders 
misused information about their customers’ trading); 7/19/2005 speech by Annette Nazareth before the Securities 
Industry Association Compliance and Legal Division Member Luncheon (discussing increased potential for 
conflicts of interest).  In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, P.L. 111-603, 
restored the prohibition on proprietary trading by banks, subject to certain exceptions.  See Section 619, amending 
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, to be codified at 12 U.S.C. §1851.  Regulations implementing Section 619, 
also known as the Merkley-Levin provisions after the Senators who authored them or the Volcker Rule after former 
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker who championed the ban, are due by October 2011.

recently issued “Report of the Business Practices Committee,” Goldman reaffirmed as its first 
business principle:  “Our clients’ interests always come first.”2782
  Contrary to that statement, 
however, Goldman documents showed its employees repeatedly expressing concern about the 
firm’s interests, but rarely mentioning or placing a priority on the interests of its clients.  In fact, 
after Goldman announced record profits for its Mortgage Department in the third quarter of 
2007, when many of its clients were suffering substantial losses from the mortgage investments 
they purchased from Goldman, Peter Kraus, co-head of the Investment Banking Division, wrote 
the following to Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein:  
 

 “I met with 10+ individual prospects and clients … since earnings were announced.  The 
institutions don’t and I wouldn’t expect them to, make any comments like ur good at 
making money for urself but not us.  The individuals do sometimes, but while it requires 
the utmost humility from us in response I feel very strongly it binds clients even closer to 
the firm, because the alternative of take ur money to a firm who is an under performer 
and not the best, just isn’t reasonable.  Clients ultimately believe that association with the 
best is good for them in the long run.”2783
 

   

The tension between Goldman’s efforts to make money on behalf of itself versus on behalf of its 
clients raises a number of conflict of interest concerns, particularly when its efforts to profit from 
shorting the mortgage market or particular RMBS or CDO securities occurred simultaneously 
with its efforts to market mortgage related securities to its clients. 
 

Goldman’s Proprietary Activities.  Until recently, when asked about the extent of the 

firm’s proprietary activities, Goldman generally claimed that its proprietary investments 
contributed only approximately 10% of the firm’s profits.2784  In January 2011, however, 
Goldman announced in an SEC filing that it was changing the categories under which it reported 
income.  Goldman added a new category called “Investments and Lending” to segregate the 
firm’s proprietary investment income from the income it derived from activities undertaken on 
behalf of clients.2785
  Based on earnings reported in January 2011 for Goldman=s full fiscal year 
2010, the proprietary investment income recorded under “Investments and Lending” accounted 

                                                           
2782  1/2011 “Report of the Business Standards Committee,” at 1.  In May 2010, at Goldman’s annual shareholders’ 
meeting, CEO Lloyd Blankfein announced the formation of a Business Standards Committee to conduct an 
extensive review of the firm’s business standards and practices to determine the extent to which the firm was 
adhering to its own written “Business Principles,” and to make appropriate recommendations.  Id.  The Committee’s 
January 2011 report provided recommendations in the areas of Client Relationships and Responsibilities, Conflicts 
of Interest, Structured Products, Transparency and Disclosure, Committee Governance, and Training and 
Professional Development.

for $7.5 billion, or about 20% of Goldman’s net revenues.2786
  Goldman did not specify how it 
defined proprietary investments and lending for purposes of its earnings report, nor what desks 
or activities contributed to the total, how it calculated the reported amount, or why it was double 
the amount cited a year earlier. 
 

To date, three Goldman units have been identified as engaging explicitly in investments 
on behalf of the firm.  One, based in New York, is called Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies or 
“GSPS,” which Goldman is reportedly in the process of dismantling.2787  The second is the 
Global Macro Proprietary Trading Desk, which had traders in New York and London and 
reportedly invested in foreign exchange markets, interest rate markets, stocks, commodities and 
other fixed income markets.2788  The third, according to Goldman, is the Special Situations 
Group or SSG, which is reportedly engaged primarily in long term investments on behalf of the 
firm and clients, with little short term trading or sales activities.2789

   

 
Proprietary Activities in the Mortgage Area.  In the mortgage area, until 2005, 

Goldman had a dedicated proprietary investment desk in the Mortgage Department called the 
Principal Finance Group, often referred to as Principal Investments.2790  According to Goldman 
personnel, that desk specialized in long term investments on behalf of Goldman in assets such as 
distressed mortgages and credit card and energy receivables, but only rarely engaged in short 
term trading.2791  In 2005, Principal Investments was folded into the Special Situations Group 
(SSG), which was then a Goldman business unit located in Asia and not part of the Mortgage 
Department.2792
operated without a desk that was explicitly dedicated to proprietary trading during 2006 and 
2007. 

  After Principal Investments personnel moved to SSG, the Mortgage Department 

 
When asked whether the Mortgage Department engaged in proprietary activities during 
2006 and 2007, Goldman executives and traders in the Mortgage Department generally resisted 
providing a direct answer, declined to identify any proprietary trades or investments, and

2788 See “Goldman to Shut Global Macro Trading Desk,” New York Times (2/16/2011).  Goldman may be 
eliminating this desk in response to the Dodd-Frank prohibition on proprietary trading. 
2789  Subcommittee interview of Darryl Herrick (10/13/2010).  To the extent that its activities are limited to long 
term investments, the SSG unit would not be affected by the Dodd-Frank prohibition on proprietary trading which 
applies only to trading accounts used “principally for the purpose of selling in the near term (or otherwise with the 
intent to resell in order to profit from short-term price movements),” and does not affect long term investments.  See 
Section 619(h)(6).  Under Section 620 of the Dodd-Frank Act, banking regulators are also conducting an 18-month 
review of all permitted bank investment activities, both long and short term, to gauge the risk of each activity, any 
negative effect the activity may have on the safety and soundness of the banking entity or the U.S. financial system, 
and the “appropriateness” of each activity for a federally insured bank.

declined to estimate or calculate how much of the Mortgage Department=s 2007 revenues or 
profits were proprietary. 
 

When asked about particular transactions, Goldman executives or traders often described 
them as examples, not of “proprietary trading,” but “principal trading” in which Goldman acted 
as a market maker.  Goldman personnel told the Subcommittee that to fulfill the firm’s role as a 
market-maker, Goldman used its own capital to amass an inventory of assets in anticipation of 
customer demand, and acted as a “principal” when building that inventory.  They indicated that 
the mortgage related assets were acquired for the purpose of accommodating existing or 
anticipated client buy and sell orders and not to produce proprietary profits for the firm. 
 

At the same time, several Goldman executives and traders told the Subcommittee that all 
of Goldman’s trading desks, including those in the Mortgage Department, were given discretion 
to trade some amount of the firm’s capital within certain limits.2793  Daniel Sparks told the 
Subcommittee:  “We told [the Firmwide Risk Committee] what we wanted to do, and they told 
us how much we could do.”2794  Joshua Birnbaum said that the amount of proprietary trading that 
a desk was allowed to do depended upon certain risk limits, but could not recall a specific or 
typical dollar amount of any risk limit assigned to the Mortgage Department as a whole or to any 
of its trading desks for proprietary trading purposes.2795  Goldman’s Chief Risk Officer Craig 
Broderick told the Subcommittee that the firm did not distinguish between “proprietary” versus 
other types of risk, because the aggregate risk levels would be the same.2796  Mr. Broderick said 
that the firm’s proprietary trading, outside of GSPS, was “embedded” in the routine business 
conducted by various trading desks and was not specifically segregated as “proprietary.”2797
   

 
Until enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, federal securities law contained no 

statutory or regulatory definition of proprietary trading by banks and generally did not require 
firms to identify or monitor their proprietary investments.2798
  The Subcommittee investigation 
found that the terms “proprietary” and “prop” were commonly used in the financial services 
industry to describe business performed on behalf of, or for the benefit of, a financial firm itself,

2797  Id.  Goldman’s Chief Financial Officer David Viniar provided similar information in response to questions from 
the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, indicating that Goldman did not specifically “break out” its proprietary 
trading from its other business results.  See FCIC Hearing, Testimony of David Viniar (7/2/2010), www.fcic.gov. 
2798  The Dodd-Frank Act defines “proprietary trading” as “engaging as a principal for the trading account of [a] 
banking entity  . . . in any transaction to purchase or sell, or otherwise acquire or dispose of, any security, any 
derivative, any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery, any option on any such security, derivative, or 
contract or any other security or financial instrument that the appropriate Federal banking agencies ... may, by rule ... 
determine.”  12 U.S.C. ' 1851(h)(4).  The Act further defines “trading account” as one used for “near term” trading 
or for capturing profits from “short term price movements.”  Section 1851(h)(6).  These provisions are subject to 
further refinement through implementing regulations.

while the term “flow” was used to refer to market-making transactions involving, or for the 
benefit of, the firm’s customers.2799

    

  
A number of internal Goldman documents in 2006 and 2007, used the terms “prop” and 

“flow” when referring to mortgage related activities.  In a 2006 email to Goldman senior 
executives, for example, Mr. Sparks, the Mortgage Department head, used the terms when 
criticizing a decision by Morgan Stanley to move its most experienced mortgage traders from its 
mortgage department’s “franchise” desk to a dedicated proprietary desk.2800
  Mr. Sparks argued 
against Goldman=s doing the same by claiming exposure to customer trades or “flows” made 
mortgage traders “more effective” in their proprietary trades: 

 
“Morgan Stanley is going overboard by taking most of their experienced and known 
traders out of the franchise.  We should keep our franchise leaders in the seats and 
continue to allow them to take prop views B the customer flows they see make them more 
effective.”2801
 

   

This email shows, not only that Mr. Sparks and other Goldman executives used the terms “prop” 
and “flow,” but they also knew Goldman mortgage traders were handling both customer and 
proprietary transactions at the same time.  
 

 
In November 2007, Mr. Sparks received an email from the Mortgage Department’s 

business manager, John McHugh, indicating that proprietary trades made up a substantial portion 
of the Department’s activities.2802  In the email, Mr. McHugh provided Mr. Sparks with a draft of 
the Department=s 2008 business plan which included a description of the projected business 
activities of the Structured Product Group – the Mortgage Department trading desk that then 
handled RMBS, CDO, and other mortgage related trading activities.  Under the heading, “Prop 
vs. Flow,” the draft plan stated:  “Prop/flow components of SPG Trading will be roughly 
equal.”2803

(“Within Corporate Banking & Securities, we conduct proprietary trading, or trading on our own account, in 
addition to providing products and services to customers.  Most trading activity is undertaken in the normal course 
of facilitating client business.  For example, to facilitate customer flow business, traders will maintain long positions 
(accumulating securities) and short positions (selling securities we do not yet own) in a range of securities and 
derivative products, reducing this exposure by hedging transactions where appropriate.  While these activities give 
rise to market and other risk, we do not view this as proprietary trading.  However, we also use our capital to exploit 
market opportunities, and this is what we term proprietary trading.”).

Expect prop flow split to be roughly 50/50.”2804

 

 
The draft business plan suggests that fully half the 2008 SPG and ABS activities were expected 
to involve proprietary investments.   
 

When the Subcommittee asked Mr. Sparks about the “prop/flow components of SPG 

Trading” in the Department’s 2008 draft business plan, Mr. Sparks indicated that he was not sure 
what his business manager meant and was unable to estimate what percentage of the SPG 
Trading Desk’s activities was spent on proprietary trades.2805
  In a later written response to 
Subcommittee questions about the email, Mr. Sparks wrote:  “‘Prop’ or ‘proprietary’ can mean 
different things to different people.”  He continued that Mr. McHugh=s email appeared to use 
“prop” to refer to investments made with a longer holding period, such as months or years, while 
“flow” seemed to refer to investments with a shorter holding period: 
 

“Defined this way, both ‘prop’ and ‘flow’ trades can involve customers, although 
sometimes the term ‘proprietary’ is used to describe business that does not involve a 
customer.  (Sometimes proprietary is used to describe any activity that involves use of a 
firm’s own capital.).”2806
 
Goldman’s Net Shorts As Proprietary Investments.  Goldman’s practice of embedding 

  

its proprietary trading activities within the ordinary trading conducted on its market-making 
mortgage trading desks, together with its unwillingness to estimate its proprietary activities, 
made it difficult to determine the extent of the proprietary trading that took place within the 
Mortgage Department from 2006 to 2007.2807
by the Mortgage Department from late 2006 to late 2007 appear to have been undertaken to 
advance the financial interests of the firm, rather than primarily to make markets for clients. 

  Nonetheless, many of the transactions undertaken 

 
Several factors suggest that transactions undertaken to build and profit from Goldman’s 
two large net short positions in 2007 were completed for Goldman’s own benefit, rather than on

2807  The difficulties associated with distinguishing between proprietary trading and market making activities are 
examined in a recent study by the new Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), an intra-governmental council 
established by the Dodd-Frank Act, comprised of ten regulators in the financial services sector, and charged with 
identifying risks and responding to emerging threats to U.S. financial stability.  See FSOC FAQs, 
www.treasury.gov; 1/2011 “Study & Recommendations on Prohibitions on Proprietary Trading & Certain 
Relationships with Hedge Funds & Private Equity Funds” (hereinafter “FSOC Study”), at 22-44.  The FSOC Study 
observed:  “Absent robust rules and protections, banking entities may have the opportunity to migrate existing 
proprietary trading activities from the standalone business units that are presently recognized as ‘proprietary 
trading” into more mainstream ‘sales and trading’ or other operations that engage in permitted activities.”  Id.  See 
also “Proprietary Trading Goes Under Cover:  Michael Lewis,” Bloomberg, (10/27/2010) (quoting a bank trader 
who reportedly said “from here on out, if he wants to take a proprietary position ... he will argue that he bought the 
position because a customer wanted to sell the position, and he was providing liquidity”).

behalf of its clients.  First, the two net short positions – totaling $10 billion in February and 
$13.9 billion in June 2007 – were far larger than a financial institution would establish simply to 
meet anticipated client demand.2808
positions was also outsized.  As indicated earlier, the Mortgage Department typically contributed 
only about 2% of Goldman’s total net revenues, yet in 2007, it was allowed to continually exceed 
its permanent Value-at-Risk (VAR) limit and incur up to 54% of firmwide risk.  The 
Subcommittee uncovered no evidence to suggest that Goldman incurred and sustained that 
disproportionately high level of risk to accommodate client demands or to hedge positions taken 
on to accommodate clients.   
 

  Second, the magnitude of the risk attached to those short 

A third factor indicating the net short positions were proprietary in nature was how long 
Goldman held onto them.  For example, the Mortgage Department maintained a $9 billion ABX 
AAA short for six to nine months in 2007.  While that short was initially used to hedge certain 
long positions held by various Mortgage Department desks, it was retained even after those long 
positions were sold off or written down.  Mr. Sparks later described the ABX AAA short as 
“disaster insurance” in case the subprime market collapsed.2809
  The Subcommittee found no 
evidence indicating that the $9 billion short was maintained over such a long period of time to 
accommodate client demand.  

 
A fourth factor indicating Goldman’s net short positions were proprietary in nature was 
the Mortgage Department’s affirmative effort to solicit clients to buy RMBS and CDO assets in 
its inventory.2810  The Subcommittee saw no evidence that this sales activity was undertaken to 
accommodate client demand; to the contrary, the documents show that the Mortgage 
Department’s sales efforts took place amid a deteriorating mortgage market and waning investor 
interest in mortgage related products.2811

 

 
Still another indicator that the Mortgage Department’s net shorts were proprietary was 

  On another occasion in March 2007, a Goldman employee 

that, when clients expressed interest in acquiring certain short positions, Goldman at times 
refused to accommodate their requests.  For example, in June 2007, when Goldman began 
building its second large net short position, its Mortgage Department refused client requests to 
purchase the short side of CDS contracts with Goldman:  “Really don=t want to offer any [shorts 
to customers]” and “too late!”2812
                                                           
2808  These totals include Goldman’s net shorts from both its mortgage trading and CDO securitization activities.

told Goldman’s Chief Risk Officer Mr. Broderick that the Mortgage Department was no longer 
buying subprime assets:  “Just fyi not for the memo, my understanding is that desk is no longer 
buying subprime.  (We are low balling on bids.).”2813
  Refusing client requests and lowballing 
bids to avoid purchases indicate that the Goldman Mortgage Department was not acting as a 
market maker to accommodate client demand. 
 

Perhaps the strongest indicator that Goldman’s large net short positions were proprietary 
investments are the statements made by Goldman’s own executives and traders.  Goldman’s head 
ABX trader, Joshua Birnbaum, described the Department’s decisions in February and June to 
build and profit from its net short positions, not as efforts to accommodate anticipated client 
demand, but as investments made on behalf of the firm to produce large profits:  

 

“Whereas execution of strategies has clearly been a concerted team effort, I consider 
myself the initial or primary driver of the macro trading direction for the business.  I 
would highlight 3 major calls here: 
1.  Dec-Feb: ...  The prevailing opinion within the department was that we should just 
‘get close to home’ and pare down our long. ... I concluded that we should not only get 
flat, but VERY short.  ...  [W]e all agreed the plan made sense. ... [W]e implemented the 
plan by hitting on almost [every] single name CDO protection buying opportunity in a 2-
month period.  Much of the plan began working by February when the market dropped 25 
points and our profitable year was underway. ... 
3.  Jun-Jul:  the BSAM [Bear Stearns Asset Management failure] changed everything.  I 
felt that this mark-to-market event for CDO risk would begin a further unraveling in 
mortgage credit.  Again, when the prevailing opinion in the department was to remain 
close to home, I pushed everyone on the desk to sell risk aggressively and quickly.  We 
sold billions of index and single name risk such that when the index dropped 25pts in 
July, we had a blow-out p&l [profit & loss] month, making over $1Bln that month. ... 

 

We made money:  a) taking large directional views, the direction of which we changed 
several times, b) ... betting the bad names would get much worse vs. the good ones, c) 
shorting CDOs, d) capturing the index to single name basis ... among other things.”2814

  

                                                                                                                                                                                           
wrote that his desk sold short positions on single name CDS contracts only to customers that could provide Goldman 
with useful information:  “We were very aggressive with pricing and only shared risk [short positions] with smart 
guys if they gave us insight on names to go short or go long in return.”).

4/27-63. 
2814  9/26/2007 EMD Reviews, Joshua Birnbaum Self-Review, GS-PSI-01975, Hearing Exhibit 4/27-55c.  Mr. 
Birnbaum’s comments indicate that Goldman’s proprietary activities extended to its CDO activities.  As explained 
earlier, while Abacus 2007-AC1 was undertaken in response to a client request, Hudson 1 was conceived by the 
Mortgage Department as a way to transfer risk associated with poorly performing ABX assets in its inventory.  
Goldman supplied 100% of the CDS contracts that made up Hudson’s assets, took 100% of the short side, and 
profited at the expense of the Hudson investors.  In October 2006, Mr. Ostrem, head of the CDO Origination Desk, 
wrote to Mr. Sparks that a client was upset, because it knew “Hudson Mezz (GS prop deal) is pushing their deal 
back,” clearly identifying Hudson as a “prop” or proprietary transaction.  10/16/2006 email from Mr. Ostrem to Mr. 
Sparks, GS MBS-E 010916991, Hearing Exhibit 4/27-59.  See also 2/25/2007 email exchange between Peter Ostrem 
and Matthew Bieber, at GS MBS-E-001996601, Hearing Exhibit 4/27-95 (Mr. Ostrem proposed allowing a hedge 

 
In a later presentation put together to propose a new compensation arrangement for the SPG 
Trading Desk’s trading activities, Mr. Birnbaum was unequivocal that the net shorts the desk had 
acquired were not hedges to offset risk, but “outright” short investments to produce profits:  
 

“By June, all retained CDO and RMBS positions were identified already hedged. ... SPG 
trading reinitiated shorts post BSAM [Bear Stearns Asset Management] unwind on an 
outright basis with no accompanying CDO or RMBS retained position longs.  In other 
words, the shorts were not a hedge.”2815

 

In his 2007 self-evaluation, Michael Swenson, head of the Mortgage Department=s SPG 

Trading Desk, described the net short positions undertaken by the firm in this way: 
 

 

632 

“It should not be a surprise to anyone that the 2007 year is the one that I am most proud 
of to date. ... extraordinary profits (nearly $3bb [billion] to date).  …  I directed the ABS 
desk to enter into a $1.8 bb short in ABS CDOs that has realized approx. $1.0bb of p & l 
[profit and loss] to date.  …  [W]e aggressively capitalized on the franchise to enter into 
efficient shorts in both the RMBS and CDO space.” 

Mr. Swenson’s description of the net short position he “directed” to be built in CDOs and 

 
 
the resulting $1 billion in profit makes no reference to client demands.  Mr. Salem, a trader on 
the ABS Desk, was equally clear in his 2007 self-evaluation that the desk made a deliberate bet 
on the direction of the mortgage market:  “Mike, Josh, and I were able to learn from our bad long 
position at the end of 2006 and layout the game plan to put on an enormous directional 
short.”2816
  Each of these three Mortgage Department employees played a key role in building 
the firm’s net short positions.  Their own statements indicate that they perceived acquiring the 
2007 net short positions to be for the benefit of the firm, and not to build an inventory of assets 
to respond to anticipated client demand. 
 

Other internal documents also portray the net short positions as decisions made by the 

firm to advance its own financial interests.  In an internal presentation to the Goldman Board of 
Directors regarding the “Subprime Mortgage Business,” for example, the Mortgage Department 
wrote that, in the first quarter of 2007, “GS reverse[d] long market position through purchase of

that ability for Goldman”); 12/29/2006 email from Mr. Birnbaum to Mr. Lehman, GS MBS-E-011360438, Hearing 
Exhibit 4/27-5 (when discussing certain proposed CDO deals that would generate $1 to $3 billion in short positions

sharing to the extent that it keeps these customers engaged with us.”).

single name CDS and reductions of ABX.”2817  In September 2007, the Goldman Board of 
Directors summarized its mortgage business this way: “Although broader weakness in the 
mortgage markets resulted in significant losses in cash position, we were overall net short the 
mortgage market and thus had very strong results.”2818  Talking points prepared for CFO David 
Viniar prior to a March 2007 earnings call with analysts stated:  “The Mortgage business’ 
revenues were primarily driven by synthetic short positions.”2819
to the SEC, Goldman wrote: 
 

  In an October 2007 letter sent 

“[W]e are active traders of mortgage securities and loans and ... we may choose to take a 
directional view of the market ....  For example, during most of 2007, we maintained a net 
short sub-prime position and therefore stood to benefit from declining prices in the 
mortgage market.”2820

 

 
In an October 2007 internal presentation to another Goldman unit, Chief Risk Officer Craig 
Broderick wrote: 
 

“So what happened to us? ...  In market risk B you saw in our 2nd and 3rd qtr results that 
we made money despite our inherently long cash positions. – because starting early in ‘07 
our mortgage trading desk started putting on big short positions ... and did so in enough 
quantity that we were net short, and made money (substantial $$ in the 3rd quarter) as the 
subprime market weakened.”2821

 

 
In a November 2007 email to his colleagues, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote:  “Of course 
we didn’t dodge the mortgage mess.  We lost money, then made more than we lost because of 
shorts.”2822
transactions were undertaken to accommodate existing or anticipated client trades.  
 

  None of these internal documents suggests that the Mortgage Department’s net short

making activities.2823
  Applying those recently developed criteria to the Mortgage Department’s 
2007 activities also supports viewing that activity as the result of proprietary rather than market 
making activities.  For example, the Mortgage Department was building its net shorts with the 
expectation that they would appreciate in value rather than provide assets to facilitate customer 
transactions; the position created risks out of proportion to those necessary to accommodate 
customer demand; the Mortgage Department actively and aggressively solicited clients to build 
its short positions; the Mortgage Department accumulated an unpredictable inventory profile in 
terms of volume and in relation to customer demand; and it had a relatively low inventory 
turnover with the bulk of the profits derived from inventory appreciation when Goldman covered 
its shorts.  
 

Advocating More Proprietary Trading.  One last set of documents shines additional 
light on the role of proprietary investments in the Goldman Mortgage Department in 2006 and 
2007.  As indicated earlier, for several years, Goldman’s Mortgage Department had a proprietary 
trading desk, Principal Investments, that was explicitly and exclusively dedicated to engaging in 
transactions for the benefit of the firm.  In 2005, it was moved to the SSG unit.  Internal 
Goldman documents show that some in the Mortgage Department wanted to revive that desk, 
increase the amount of proprietary trading in the mortgage area, or claim a greater share of the 
proprietary profits created by the Mortgage Department for the firm.  
 

In August 2006, for example, the CDO Origination Desk proposed that Goldman 

establish a formal proprietary trading fund or proprietary trading operation within the Mortgage 
Department to conduct mortgage related transactions on behalf of the firm.  In an August 2006 
email, Peter Ostrem, the CDO Origination Desk head, made the proposal to Mr. Sparks, the 
Mortgage Department head: 
 

“Let’s do our own fund.  SP [Structured Product] CDO desk.  Big time.  GS [Goldman 
Sachs] commits to hold proportion of equity outright.  This could be big. ...  I need real 
leverage.  Got some structured ideas too.  When can we talk strategy for an hour or 
so?”2824

 

 
Mr. Sparks responded:  “Next week.  In the meantime calm the blank down.”2825  Later the same 
day, he later wrote to Mr. Ostrem:  “Not going to happen.”2826  When asked about these emails, 
Mr. Sparks told the Subcommittee that Goldman decided not to allow the Mortgage Department 
to set up its own hedge fund or explicit proprietary trading desk.2827

635 

In March 2007, after a series of large trades with the Harbinger hedge fund on the ABS 
Desk, Deeb Salem, an ABS trader, emailed Mr. Birnbaum, Mr. Swenson, and Mr. Chin with a 
proposal for a proprietary CDO: 
 

“Am I crazy to be thinking we might want to grow the harbinger trade and do our own 
abs desk cdo.  There’ll be so much juice in it.  It would blow out.  We could sell 
supersenior and maybe some equity.  Then the remaining mezz would be a cover of a 
couple hundred million of our cdo short.  Haven’t crunched the numbers, but I’m 
guessing we’d effectively cover well north of 1000 plus own some call rights.  Or we also 
keep the equity and own it for free.  

 

 

To select the portfolio, we look at the underlying rmbs deals in our cdo shorts.  And 
replicate that as best as possible.”2828

 

 
Mr. Birnbaum replied:  “I like it.”2829  Mr. Swenson responded:  “Love it we will give dan 
[Sparks] a heart attack.”2830  Two months later, in June 2007, Mr. Swenson wrote Mr. Salem:  
“Talk to me now things are developing - dan wants you to be the epicenter of the subprime 
universe which is not a bad position to be in.”2831
 

  Mr. Salem replied:   

“That’s fine.  My number 1 concern is that it[’]s traded by the right people bc [because] 
the opportunity is huge.  It’s a product that needs to be traded as a prop product. ... U 
need to be in charge and we need prop minded guys involved.”2832

 

 
That same month, however, the Bear Stearns’ hedge funds collapsed due to losses from their 
subprime holdings.  In July, the mass ratings downgrades took place, and the RMBS subprime 
market began to shut down as well.  The Subcommittee saw no evidence that the proprietary 
CDO proposed by Mr. Salem was carried out. 
 

In July 2007, Mr. Birnbaum, Goldman’s head ABX trader, remarked that Goldman was 

giving John Paulson, the head of the Paulson Partners hedge funds, “a run for his money” in 
shorting the mortgage market, and claimed Goldman was “No. 2” behind the Paulson hedge 
funds in profiting from a massive net short position.2833  In October 2007, Mr. Birnbaum drafted 
a proposal that the SPG Trading Desk be compensated in accordance with a hedge fund model, 
rather than through Goldman’s bonus pool, so the desk could obtain a portion of the proprietary 
profits it was generating.2834

  He discussed the proposal with other Mortgage Department

D.   Preventing Investment Bank Abuses   

Developments over the past two years offer a number of ways to address problems 

 
Proprietary trading was not prohibited by law in 2007, and Goldman was free to and did 
engage in billions of dollars in mortgage related trades for its own account.  The Goldman case 
study also demonstrates how proprietary trading, when undertaken at the same time as trading on 
behalf of clients, can give rise to conflicts of interest between the bank’s financial interests and 
those of its clients.  The new proprietary trading and conflict of interest restrictions in the Dodd-
Frank Act are designed to address and reduce these conflicts.  
 
 
 
 
identified in the Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank case studies.  The success of those 
alternatives will depend in large part upon how they are implemented, and the degree to which 
the market disruptions caused by the financial crisis convince investment banks to realign their 
use of structured finance products, curb their proprietary trading, and respect the interests of their 
clients.  Success will also depend upon sensible implementation of the measures enacted into law 
by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). 
 
 
 
 
Three key provisions involve proprietary investments, conflicts of interest, and a new study of 
permitted banking activities.   
 
 
affiliates, including any investment banks,2837 are prohibited by the Dodd-Frank Act from 
engaging in proprietary trading, subject to certain provisions allowing them to continue to serve 
clients and reduce risks. 2838  The proprietary trading ban will still allow banks, for example, to 
continue to engage in transactions as market makers for clients, hedge their risks, and maintain 
very limited investments in private funds they sponsor or manage for others.2839
 
 
activities.  It explicitly bars any proprietary trading activity that “would involve or result in a 
material conflict of interest … between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or

Investment banks that have no bank affiliation are not subject to the law's proprietary 

 
counterparties,” or that would result “in a material exposure by the banking entity to high-risk 
assets or high-risk trading strategies.” 2840
  Those express limitations are intended to reduce not 
only the risk of proprietary trading losses, but also the conflicts of interest that arise when a 
bank-affiliated investment bank enters into an activity that allows it to profit at the expense of its 
clients. 
 
 
trading prohibition.  If, however, an investment bank is designated by the newly-created 
Financial Stability Oversight Council as a systemically critical firm, the Dodd-Frank Act would 
subject its proprietary trading to additional capital requirements and quantitative limits.  Those 
restrictions are intended to ensure large investment banks have sufficient safeguards in place 
when engaging in risky proprietary activities to prevent them from damaging the U.S. financial 
system as a whole or necessitating a taxpayer bailout if they get into financial trouble. 
 
 Private Fund Restrictions.  To ensure that the proprietary trading restrictions are 
 
effective, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates, including any investment 
banks, from bailing out any private fund they advise or sponsor, including an affiliated hedge 
fund or private equity fund. 2841   This prohibition would apply, for example, to Deutsche Bank 
and its affiliated hedge fund, Winchester Capital, which made a large proprietary investment in 
mortgage related products. 2842  These restrictions would not apply to investment banks that are 
not affiliated with a bank.  If, however, the investment bank is designated as a systemically 
critical firm, it would become subject to additional capital charges to account for the risk that it  
may end up bailing out a private fund.  The private fund provision also addresses the issue of 
eliminating any unfair advantage that banks may have from being able to rely on the special 
privileges of being a bank to implicitly guarantee a private fund, and ensures that a federally 
insured bank will not be put at risk if an affiliated private fund suffers losses.2843
 
 
described the link between proprietary trading and conflicts of interest as follows: 
 

 Conflict of Interest Prohibitions.  In 2009, one well known investment adviser

“Proprietary trading by banks has become by degrees over recent years an egregious 
conflict of interest with their clients.  Most if not all banks that prop trade now gather 
information from their institutional clients and exploit it.  In complete contrast, 30 years 
ago, Goldman Sachs, for example, would never, ever have traded against its clients.  How 
quaint that scrupulousness now seems.  Indeed, from, say, 1935 to 1980, any banker who 
suggested such behavior would have been fired as both unprincipled and a threat to the 
partners’ money.”2844

Study of Banking Activities.  Section 620 of the Dodd-Frank Act directs banking 

The Dodd-Frank Act contains two conflict of interest prohibitions to restore the ethical 

 
 
bar against investment banks and other financial institutions profiting at the expense of their 
clients.  The first is a broad prohibition that applies in any circumstances in which a firm trades 
for its own account, as explained above.2845  The second, in Section 621, imposes a specific, 
explicit prohibition on any firm that underwrites, sponsors, or acts as a placement agent for an 
asset backed security, including a synthetic asset backed security, from engaging in a transaction 
“that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest” with an investor in that 
security.2846
  Together, these two prohibitions, if well implemented, will protect market 
participants from the self-dealing that contributed to the financial crisis.   
 
 
regulators to review what types of banking activities are currently allowed under federal and 
state law, submit a report to Congress and the Financial Stability Oversight Council on those 
activities, and offer recommendations to restrict activities that are inappropriate or may have a 
negative effect on the safety and soundness of a banking entity or the U.S. financial system.  This 
study could evaluate, for example, the use of complex structured finance products that are 
difficult to understand, have little or no track record on performance, and encourage investors to 
bet on the failure rather than the success of financial instruments. 
 
 
related to approval of new products and standards of business conduct,2847 the banking agencies, 
SEC, and CFTC may update and strengthen existing guidance on new structured finance 
products.  In 2004, after the collapse of the Enron Corporation, the banking regulators and SEC 
proposed joint guidance to prevent abusive structured finance transactions. 2848   This guidance, 
which was not finalized until January 2007, was issued in a much weaker form.2849
  The final 
guidance eliminated, for example, warnings against structured finance products that facilitate 
deceptive accounting, circumvention of regulatory or financial reporting requirements, or tax 
evasion, as well as detailed guidance on the roles that should be played by a financial institution's 
board of directors, senior management, and legal counsel in approving new products and on the 
documentation they should assemble.

1. Review Structured Finance Transactions.  Federal regulators should review the 

RMBS, CDO, CDS, and ABX activities described in this Report to identify any 
violations of law and to examine ways to strengthen existing regulatory prohibitions 
against abusive practices involving structured finance products. 

2. Narrow Proprietary Trading Exceptions.  To ensure a meaningful ban on 

proprietary trading under Section 619, any exceptions to that ban, such as for market-
making or risk-mitigating hedging activities, should be strictly limited in the 
implementing regulations to activities that serve clients or reduce risk.   

3. Design Strong Conflict of Interest Prohibitions.  Regulators implementing the 

conflict of interest prohibitions in Sections 619 and 621 should consider the types of 
conflicts of interest in the Goldman Sachs case study, as identified in Chapter VI(C)(6) 
of this Report.   

4. Study Bank Use of Structured Finance.  Regulators conducting the banking 

activities study under Section 620 should consider the role of federally insured banks 
in designing, marketing, and investing in structured finance products with risks that 
cannot be reliably measured and naked credit default swaps or synthetic financial 
instruments.
